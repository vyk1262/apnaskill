        {
          "question": "What is a `Custom Resource Definition` (CRD) in Kubernetes?",
          "options": {
            "A": "A built-in Kubernetes resource like a Pod or Service.",
            "B": "A mechanism that allows you to define your own custom resources with their own schema and API endpoints, extending Kubernetes's API.",
            "C": "A way to customize the Kubernetes dashboard.",
            "D": "A tool for creating new container images."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "CRDs allow you to extend Kubernetes's API by defining new types of resources. Once a CRD is created, you can create objects of that custom type, and Kubernetes will store and manage them like native resources (e.g., Pods), enabling domain-specific abstractions."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is a 'Kubernetes Operator', and what problem does it solve?",
          "options": {
            "A": "A type of advanced network load balancer.",
            "B": "An application-specific controller that extends the Kubernetes API to create, configure, and manage instances of complex applications (especially stateful ones) using domain-specific knowledge.",
            "C": "A tool for manual cluster management.",
            "D": "A special type of Pod that runs on every node."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "An Operator is a method of packaging, deploying, and managing a Kubernetes-native application. It leverages CRDs to represent the application's domain logic and custom controllers to automate the operational tasks (e.g., upgrades, backups, scaling) that would typically be done by a human operator for a specific application."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is `Kubebuilder` or `Operator SDK` used for?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To deploy applications to a Kubernetes cluster.",
            "B": "To simplify the development of Kubernetes Operators by providing tools, libraries, and code generation capabilities.",
            "C": "To monitor Kubernetes cluster performance.",
            "D": "To manage container registries."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Kubebuilder and Operator SDK are frameworks that streamline the development of Kubernetes Operators. They provide scaffolding, code generation for CRDs and controllers, and libraries to interact with the Kubernetes API, making it easier to build sophisticated automation for custom resources."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is `kube-scheduler`'s role in advanced scheduling scenarios (e.g., with custom schedulers)?",
          "options": {
            "A": "It exclusively handles all Pod scheduling decisions.",
            "B": "While it's the default scheduler, Kubernetes allows for custom schedulers to be deployed alongside or in place of it to implement more complex scheduling logic (e.g., batch scheduling, topology-aware scheduling).",
            "C": "It only schedules Control Plane components.",
            "D": "It's responsible for Pod networking."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The default `kube-scheduler` handles general-purpose scheduling. For advanced scenarios requiring specific scheduling policies (e.g., gang scheduling for HPC, scheduling based on GPU types, or cost optimization), you can develop and deploy custom schedulers that run in parallel with the default one, or even replace it."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the primary purpose of 'Taints and Tolerations'?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To manage network policies for Pods.",
            "B": "Taints are applied to Nodes to repel certain Pods, while Tolerations are applied to Pods to allow them to be scheduled on Nodes with matching taints, enabling specialized node usage.",
            "C": "To configure persistent storage for applications.",
            "D": "To monitor application logs."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Taints are a property of Nodes; they mark a node to 'repel' Pods unless those Pods have a matching 'toleration'. This mechanism is used to reserve nodes for specific workloads (e.g., GPU nodes), isolate problematic nodes, or manage highly available Control Plane nodes."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is `Affinity` and `Anti-affinity` in Kubernetes scheduling?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Rules for network communication between Pods.",
            "B": "Rules that attract (affinity) or repel (anti-affinity) Pods to or from certain Nodes or other Pods based on labels, allowing for flexible and powerful scheduling policies (e.g., co-locating services, spreading replicas).",
            "C": "Rules for resource allocation.",
            "D": "Rules for persistent volume access."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Affinity (Node Affinity, Pod Affinity) expresses preferences or hard requirements for Pods to be scheduled on certain Nodes or near other Pods. Anti-affinity (Pod Anti-affinity) expresses a preference or requirement for Pods to *not* be scheduled on the same Node or near other Pods. These are used for performance, availability, and cost optimization."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is `Admission Control` beyond just `Pod Security Admission`?",
          "options": {
            "A": "A system for user authentication.",
            "B": "A set of modules that intercept requests to the Kubernetes API server *after* authentication and authorization but *before* objects are persisted, allowing for validation, mutation, or rejection of requests based on defined policies.",
            "C": "A tool for network traffic filtering.",
            "D": "A component for managing storage classes."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Admission Controllers are powerful components that enforce policies on API requests. Beyond security (like Pod Security Admission), they can enforce resource quotas, modify object definitions, ensure specific labels are present, or integrate with external policy engines like OPA Gatekeeper."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is `OPA Gatekeeper` in relation to Kubernetes security?",
          "options": {
            "A": "A load balancer.",
            "B": "An open-source project that allows cluster administrators to enforce policies on Kubernetes clusters using the Open Policy Agent (OPA) policy engine and Admission Control.",
            "C": "A network monitoring tool.",
            "D": "A specialized logging agent."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "OPA Gatekeeper is an Admission Controller that integrates Kubernetes with Open Policy Agent (OPA). It allows you to define flexible and powerful policies (written in Rego language) to validate and mutate API requests, enforcing governance and compliance rules across your cluster."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is a `Custom Metrics API` and how does it extend Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)?",
          "options": {
            "A": "A way to monitor Node performance.",
            "B": "An API that allows HPA to scale Pods based on application-specific metrics (e.g., requests per second, queue depth) that are not CPU or memory, enabling more nuanced autoscaling logic.",
            "C": "An API for collecting logs.",
            "D": "An API for persistent volume statistics."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "While HPA can use basic CPU/memory metrics from `metrics-server`, the Custom Metrics API allows it to scale based on any metric exposed by your application (e.g., using Prometheus and `k8s-prometheus-adapter`) or other monitoring systems. This is crucial for applications where CPU/memory aren't direct indicators of load."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the `External Metrics API` and how does it extend Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)?",
          "options": {
            "A": "It's for metrics inside the cluster only.",
            "B": "An API that allows HPA to scale Pods based on metrics originating from outside the Kubernetes cluster (e.g., queue size in an external message broker, database connection count), enabling autoscaling based on external system load.",
            "C": "An API for system logs.",
            "D": "An API for network configuration."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The External Metrics API allows HPA to scale based on metrics that are external to the Kubernetes cluster itself. For example, if your application scales based on the number of messages in an AWS SQS queue or the number of active users from a SaaS platform, this API enables that integration."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is `Service Mesh` (e.g., Istio, Linkerd) in Kubernetes?",
          "options": {
            "A": "A tool for building container images.",
            "B": "A dedicated infrastructure layer that handles service-to-service communication, adding capabilities like traffic management, policy enforcement, security (mTLS), and observability without modifying application code.",
            "C": "A type of shared storage for applications.",
            "D": "A framework for Continuous Integration."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "A Service Mesh provides an abstraction layer for network communication between services. It typically involves a 'sidecar proxy' (e.g., Envoy) deployed alongside each application Pod, intercepting all network traffic and providing advanced features like routing, retries, circuit breaking, mTLS, and detailed telemetry."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is `Chaos Engineering` in the context of Kubernetes?",
          "options": {
            "A": "A method for securely deploying applications.",
            "B": "The practice of intentionally injecting faults and failures into a Kubernetes cluster and applications (e.g., killing Pods, network latency) to proactively identify weaknesses and improve resilience.",
            "C": "A technique for optimizing resource usage.",
            "D": "A way to manage configuration files."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Chaos Engineering is a discipline of experimenting on a system in order to build confidence in that system's capability to withstand turbulent conditions in production. In Kubernetes, this means simulating node failures, network partitions, Pod terminations, etc., to ensure the system gracefully recovers."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is a `KubeVirt`?",
          "options": {
            "A": "A Kubernetes component for virtual networking.",
            "B": "An open-source project that allows you to run virtual machines (VMs) alongside containers in a Kubernetes cluster, bridging the gap between traditional VM workloads and containerized applications.",

          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "KubeVirt allows Kubernetes to manage VMs alongside containers. It uses CRDs and Operators to provide a unified management plane for both types of workloads, enabling migration of legacy VM applications to Kubernetes while still leveraging its orchestration capabilities."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the purpose of `kube-controller-manager`'s `--controllers` flag?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To list all available controllers.",
            "B": "To enable or disable specific controllers that `kube-controller-manager` runs (e.g., endpoints controller, replication controller), allowing for fine-grained control over cluster behavior.",
            "C": "To control external services.",
            "D": "To configure network interfaces."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The `kube-controller-manager` runs various controllers (e.g., Deployment controller, StatefulSet controller, ServiceAccount controller). The `--controllers` flag allows administrators to selectively enable or disable these built-in controllers, which can be useful for debugging or when running custom controllers that supersede the built-in ones."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is `eBPF` and its emerging role in Kubernetes networking and security?",
          "options": {
            "A": "A new container runtime.",
            "B": "A powerful, programmable in-kernel technology that allows for dynamic, efficient, and safe network and security functions (e.g., advanced load balancing, network policies, observability) to be implemented directly in the kernel without modifying kernel source code.",
            "C": "A type of persistent storage.",
            "D": "A framework for managing certificates."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) is revolutionizing Linux networking and security. CNI plugins like Cilium leverage eBPF for highly performant network policies, advanced load balancing (replacing kube-proxy's iptables), and deep network observability at the kernel level."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is `Cluster Federation` (or `KubeFed`) for, and what problem does it attempt to solve?",

            "A": "The API for defining container images.",
            "B": "An API for the Kubelet to communicate with different container runtimes (e.g., containerd, CRI-O) to manage Pods and their containers, ensuring Kubernetes can work with various container technologies.",
            "C": "The interface for exposing container metrics.",
            "D": "The command-line interface for Docker."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The CRI is a plugin interface that allows the Kubelet to use any container runtime that implements the CRI specification. This decouples Kubernetes from specific container runtimes, promoting flexibility and innovation in the container ecosystem (e.g., easily swapping Docker for containerd or CRI-O)."
        },
        {
          "question": "True or False: Using advanced Kubernetes concepts always results in a simpler, easier-to-manage cluster.",
