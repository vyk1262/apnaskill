        {
          "question": "What are structured arrays in NumPy?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Arrays with a fixed size and data type for all elements.",
            "B": "Arrays where each element can have its own data type and can be thought of as a 'record' or 'struct' in C.",
            "C": "Multi-dimensional arrays with a specific organization of sub-arrays.",
            "D": "Arrays that can only store string data types."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Structured arrays in NumPy allow you to define a compound data type, where each element (or 'record') can contain fields of different data types and sizes, similar to a `struct` in C or a row in a database table. This is distinct from regular NumPy arrays where all elements have the same single data type."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do you define the data type for a structured array in NumPy?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Using a list of tuples, where each tuple specifies the name and data type of a field.",
            "B": "By creating a separate 'dtype' array and assigning it to the structured array.",
            "C": "Structured arrays do not require a specific data type definition.",
            "D": "Using a dictionary where keys are field names and values are data types."
          },
          "correct_answer": "A",
          "explanation": "The data type for a structured array is typically defined using a list of tuples. Each tuple contains `(field_name, data_type)`, for example, `[('name', 'S10'), ('age', 'i4')]`."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are masked arrays in NumPy primarily used for?",
          "options": {
            "A": "For performing bitwise operations on arrays.",
            "B": "For handling arrays with missing or invalid data by associating a boolean mask with the data.",
            "C": "For optimizing numerical computations on large arrays.",
            "D": "For creating arrays with specific patterns or shapes."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Masked arrays (from `numpy.ma` module) are specialized arrays that allow you to treat certain values as 'invalid' or 'missing'. This is done by associating a boolean mask with the data, where `True` in the mask indicates a masked (invalid) data point, and `False` indicates a valid data point. Operations on masked arrays typically ignore masked values."
        },
        {
          "question": "How is the mask in a NumPy masked array represented?",
          "options": {
            "A": "By using a special 'NaN' (Not a Number) value for missing elements.",
            "B": "By a separate boolean array of the same shape, where `True` indicates a masked (invalid) value.",
            "C": "By assigning a specific data type to represent missing values.",
            "D": "Masked arrays do not use a separate representation for missing values."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "A masked array internally stores both the data array and a separate boolean mask array. For every element in the data array, there's a corresponding boolean value in the mask. If the mask value is `True`, the data element is considered masked (invalid) and is ignored in calculations. While NaNs can indicate missing data in regular arrays, masked arrays offer a more explicit and controllable way to handle them."

        {
          "question": "What is the purpose of NumPy's C-API?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To allow NumPy arrays to be easily converted to C data structures.",
            "B": "To provide a way for C or C++ code to interact with NumPy arrays and use NumPy's functionality.",
            "C": "To optimize Python code that uses NumPy by translating it to C.",
            "D": "To visualize NumPy arrays using C libraries."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "NumPy provides a C-API (Application Programming Interface) that allows developers to write C or C++ extensions that can efficiently work with NumPy arrays. This is crucial for performance-critical computations that benefit from compiled languages, enabling seamless data exchange and function calls between Python and C."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which of the following is a benefit of using NumPy's C-API?",
          "options": {
            "A": "It makes Python code run slower but more memory-efficient.",
            "B": "It allows for the creation of custom array iterators and data types in C for performance-critical applications.",
            "C": "It simplifies the process of writing pure Python code for numerical tasks.",
            "D": "It automatically translates existing C/C++ code to Python NumPy."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The primary benefit of the C-API is to enable high-performance operations by allowing custom C/C++ code to directly access and manipulate NumPy array data. This is particularly useful for complex algorithms or when integrating with existing C/C++ libraries. It doesn't simplify pure Python code or automatically translate C++ to Python."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are universal functions (ufuncs) in NumPy?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Functions that operate on single elements of an array.",
            "B": "Functions implemented in C that perform element-wise operations on NumPy arrays, offering significant speed improvements.",
            "C": "Functions used for creating universal constants in NumPy.",
            "D": "Functions that can operate on arrays of any data type without explicit casting."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Ufuncs (universal functions) are vectorized wrappers around C functions. They operate element-wise on NumPy arrays, supporting broadcasting and various input/output configurations. Their implementation in C makes them very fast, avoiding explicit Python loops."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which of the following is an example of a NumPy ufunc?",
          "options": {
            "A": "numpy.array()",
            "B": "numpy.reshape()",
            "C": "numpy.sin()",
            "D": "numpy.concatenate()"
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "`numpy.sin()` is a common example of a ufunc. Ufuncs typically perform mathematical operations element-wise (e.g., `sin`, `cos`, `add`, `multiply`). `numpy.array()` creates an array, `numpy.reshape()` changes its shape, and `numpy.concatenate()` joins arrays, none of which are ufuncs."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the purpose of the `out` argument in many NumPy ufuncs?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To specify the data type of the output array.",
            "B": "To provide an existing array where the result of the ufunc will be stored, avoiding the creation of a new array.",
            "C": "To define the shape of the output array.",
            "D": "To specify the number of output arrays the ufunc should return."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The `out` argument in ufuncs allows you to provide an existing array as a buffer for the result. This can be beneficial for performance and memory management in large computations, as it avoids allocating new memory for the output array."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are NumPy broadcasting rules primarily designed to handle efficiently?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Operations between arrays of the exact same shape.",
            "B": "Operations between arrays with compatible shapes without the need for explicit looping or large intermediate arrays.",
            "C": "Operations involving scalar values and arrays.",
            "D": "Both B and C"
          },
          "correct_answer": "D",
          "explanation": "Broadcasting is NumPy's mechanism for working with arrays of different shapes when performing arithmetic operations. It efficiently extends smaller arrays across larger arrays so that they have compatible shapes for element-wise operations, eliminating the need for explicit looping or creating large temporary arrays. This includes operations between arrays and scalars (which are effectively broadcast)."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are NumPy iterators used for?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To perform element-wise operations on multiple arrays simultaneously.",
            "B": "To provide a flexible way to access all elements of a NumPy array, especially for multi-dimensional arrays, in a controlled manner.",
            "C": "To optimize the speed of mathematical functions in NumPy.",
            "D": "To handle missing data in NumPy arrays."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "NumPy iterators (like `numpy.nditer`) provide a highly flexible and efficient way to iterate over the elements of one or more arrays. They are particularly useful for working with multi-dimensional arrays, allowing controlled traversal order, buffering, and even read-write access to elements. While ufuncs perform element-wise operations, iterators provide the underlying mechanism for custom, efficient element access."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the difference between a NumPy view and a copy?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Views are faster to create but consume more memory.",
            "B": "Changes made to a view affect the original array, while changes to a copy do not.",
            "C": "Copies are created using slicing, while views are created using fancy indexing.",
            "D": "There is no functional difference between them."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "This is a fundamental concept in NumPy. A 'view' is a new array object that looks at the *same data* as the original array. Modifying the view will directly modify the original array. A 'copy' is a new array object with a completely *new and independent copy of the data*. Changes to a copy do not affect the original array."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which of the following operations typically creates a view of a NumPy array?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Using the `copy()` method.",
            "B": "Basic slicing (e.g., `arr[1:5]`).",
            "C": "Fancy indexing (e.g., `arr[[1, 3, 5]]`).",
            "D": "Reshaping an array with a different total number of elements."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Basic slicing (e.g., `arr[1:5]`, `arr[:, 0]`) in NumPy typically returns a view of the original array. The `copy()` method explicitly creates a copy. Fancy indexing and operations that change the total number of elements (like `resize()` or some `reshape()` operations when data is not contiguous) generally create copies."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are NumPy's `einsum` function used for?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Efficiently performing element-wise string operations on arrays.",
            "B": "Evaluating Einstein's summation convention on tensors (multi-dimensional arrays) in a concise way.",
            "C": "Creating identity matrices of arbitrary dimensions.",
            "D": "Handling complex number operations in NumPy."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "`numpy.einsum()` is a highly versatile function that uses Einstein summation convention to perform a wide variety of array operations, including dot products, outer products, transpositions, and reductions, often in a more concise and potentially more optimized way than using multiple explicit NumPy functions."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are NumPy memory views?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Copies of NumPy arrays stored in non-contiguous memory locations.",
            "B": "Objects that provide a way to access the internal data of a NumPy array without creating a full copy, especially useful for interacting with other libraries.",
            "C": "Visualizations of how NumPy arrays are stored in memory.",
            "D": "Optimized data structures for very large arrays that don't fit into RAM."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "NumPy arrays are built on top of the buffer protocol in Python, which allows other Python objects to expose their internal data as 'memory views'. A memory view is a non-copying view into the memory of an array, allowing other libraries (like Cython, other C extensions) to efficiently work with NumPy array data without the overhead of copying."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the purpose of the `order` argument in some NumPy array creation and manipulation functions (e.g., `reshape`, `flatten`)?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To specify the sorting order of elements.",
            "B": "To define the order in which multi-dimensional array elements are read or written to memory ('C' for row-major, 'F' for column-major).",
            "C": "To determine the number of dimensions of the resulting array.",
            "D": "To set the data type of the array."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The `order` argument in functions like `reshape` or `flatten` (and `copy`) specifies the memory layout for the array. 'C' order (row-major) means elements are stored row by row (like in C/C++). 'F' order (column-major) means elements are stored column by column (like in Fortran). This affects how the array is traversed or interpreted when its shape changes."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are NumPy's polynomial functions (in `numpy.polynomial`) used for?",

            "C": "Optimizing numerical algorithms using polynomial approximations.",
            "D": "Visualizing polynomial functions."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The `numpy.polynomial` package provides tools for working with various types of polynomials (e.g., Legendre, Chebyshev, Hermite, Power series). It allows for tasks like representing polynomials by their coefficients, evaluating them, finding roots, differentiation, integration, and fitting data to polynomial curves."
        },

            "A": "Analyzing stock market data.",
            "B": "Performing common financial calculations like present value, future value, and internal rate of return.",
            "C": "Converting currencies between different exchange rates.",
            "D": "Optimizing investment portfolios."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The `numpy.financial` module (which was often included directly in older NumPy versions but is now typically a separate package like `numpy_financial`) provides functions for various financial calculations such as Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), Future Value (FV), Present Value (PV), and payment calculations."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are NumPy's discrete Fourier transform (DFT) functions (in `numpy.fft`) used for?",

            "D": "Generating random numbers with specific frequency distributions."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The `numpy.fft` module provides functions for computing the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and its inverse, as well as Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithms. These are fundamental tools in signal processing for analyzing the frequency content of discrete signals, which is useful in fields like audio processing, image processing, and communications."

          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The `numpy.linalg` module provides a comprehensive set of functions for linear algebra operations, which are core to many scientific and engineering applications. This includes matrix and vector products, determinants, inverses, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, singular value decomposition, and solving linear systems."
