        {
          "question": "What is Python?",
          "options": {
            "A": "A high-level programming language",
            "B": "A type of snake",
            "C": "A database management system",
            "D": "An operating system"
          },
          "correct_answer": "A",
          "explanation": "Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. It is known for its simplicity and readability, making it popular for various applications from web development to data science."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which of the following is a characteristic of Python?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Compiled language",
            "B": "Low-level language",
            "C": "Interpreted language",
            "D": "Machine-level language"
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "Python is an interpreted language. This means that Python code is executed directly by an interpreter, line by line, without needing to be compiled into machine code beforehand. This characteristic contributes to faster development cycles."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which command is used to check the Python version installed?",
          "options": {
            "A": "python --check",
            "B": "python --version",
            "C": "python -install",
            "D": "python --info"
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "To check the version of Python installed on your system, you can open a terminal or command prompt and run the command `python --version` (or `python3 --version` if you have multiple Python versions installed)."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do you print text in Python?",
          "options": {
            "A": "echo('Hello')",
            "B": "write('Hello')",
            "C": "print('Hello')",
            "D": "display('Hello')"
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "In Python, the built-in `print()` function is used to output text or variable values to the console. The text to be printed is passed as an argument inside the parentheses, typically enclosed in single or double quotes for strings."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which of the following is a valid variable name in Python?",
          "options": {
            "A": "1_variable",
            "B": "_variable",
            "C": "variable name",
            "D": "var-name"
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "In Python, variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (`_`). They cannot start with a number. Spaces and hyphens (`-`) are not allowed in variable names; instead, underscores are used to separate words (e.g., `my_variable`). Therefore, `_variable` is a valid name."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which data type is used for True and False values?",
          "options": {
            "A": "String",
            "B": "Boolean",
            "C": "Integer",
            "D": "Float"
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The Boolean data type (`bool`) is used to represent truth values, which can only be either `True` or `False`. These values are fundamental for conditional logic and control flow in programming."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the result of 5 + 3 * 2?",
          "options": {
            "A": "16",
            "B": "13",
            "C": "11",
            "D": "10"
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "According to the standard order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), multiplication is performed before addition. So, `3 * 2` is `6`. Then, `5 + 6` equals `11`. (Note: There seems to be a discrepancy between the provided options and the correct mathematical result of the expression. Based on operator precedence, `5 + 3 * 2` evaluates to 11, not 13.)"
        },
        {
          "question": "Which operator is used for exponentiation in Python?",
          "options": {
            "A": "^",
            "B": "**",
            "C": "^^",
            "D": "exp"
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "In Python, the double asterisk (`**`) operator is used for exponentiation. For example, `2 ** 3` calculates 2 raised to the power of 3, resulting in 8."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the output of print(10 % 3)?",
          "options": {
            "A": "3",
            "B": "1",
            "C": "0",
            "D": "10"
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The `%` operator in Python is the modulo operator, which returns the remainder of a division. When 10 is divided by 3, the quotient is 3 with a remainder of 1."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which of these is a logical operator in Python?",
          "options": {
            "A": "and",
            "B": "not",
            "C": "or",
            "D": "All of the above"
          },
          "correct_answer": "D",
          "explanation": "Python uses the keywords `and`, `or`, and `not` as logical operators. They are used to combine conditional statements or to reverse the logical state of a boolean expression."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which keyword is used to take input from the user?",
          "options": {
            "A": "scanf",
            "B": "input",
            "C": "read",
            "D": "get"
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The `input()` function in Python is used to get input from the user via the console. It reads a line of text entered by the user until a newline character is encountered and returns it as a string."
        },
        {
          "question": "What will be the output of: print('Python'[2])?",
          "options": {
            "A": "P",
            "B": "y",
            "C": "t",
            "D": "h"
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "In Python, strings are indexed starting from 0. So, 'P' is at index 0, 'y' is at index 1, and 't' is at index 2. Therefore, `Python[2]` accesses the character at the third position, which is 't'."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which function is used to convert an integer to a string?",
          "options": {
            "A": "int()",
            "B": "str()",
            "C": "float()",
            "D": "bool()"
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The `str()` function in Python is used for type conversion. It converts the argument provided to it (in this case, an integer) into its string representation."
        },
        {
          "question": "What will be the output of print(2 == 2.0)?",
          "options": {
            "A": "True",
            "B": "False",
            "C": "Error",
            "D": "2.0"
          },
          "correct_answer": "A",
          "explanation": "In Python, the `==` operator checks for equality of value, not necessarily type. While `2` is an integer and `2.0` is a float, their numerical values are equivalent. Python's comparison logic correctly determines them to be equal, resulting in `True`."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which of these symbols is used for comments in Python?",
          "options": {
            "A": "//",
            "B": "#",
            "C": "/* */",
            "D": ""
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "In Python, the hash symbol (`#`) is used to denote a single-line comment. Any text following the `#` on that line is ignored by the interpreter. Other symbols are used for comments in different programming languages or markup languages."
        },
        {
          "question": "What will be the output of: print(10 // 3)?",
          "options": {
            "A": "3.33",
            "B": "3",
            "C": "1",
            "D": "0"
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The `//` operator in Python performs floor division. It divides the first number by the second and returns the largest integer less than or equal to the actual quotient. For `10 // 3`, the result is `3` (as 10 divided by 3 is 3.33..., and the floor is 3)."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which data type is used to store text?",
          "options": {
            "A": "int",
            "B": "str",
            "C": "bool",
            "D": "float"
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The `str` (string) data type in Python is used to store sequences of characters, which are typically used to represent text. Strings are immutable, meaning their content cannot be changed after creation."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the correct syntax to declare a string variable in Python?",
          "options": {
            "A": "str name = 'John'",
            "B": "name = John",
            "C": "name = 'John'",
            "D": "string name = 'John'"
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "In Python, variables are declared by simply assigning a value to them. You do not need to specify the data type explicitly. Strings are defined by enclosing the text in single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`\"`). So, `name = 'John'` is the correct syntax."
        },
        {
          "question": "What will be the output of print(type(3.14))?",
          "options": {

            "D": "<class 'bool'>"
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "The `type()` function returns the type of the object passed as its argument. `3.14` is a number with a decimal component, which Python recognizes as a floating-point number. Hence, its type is `<class 'float'>`."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do you add a comment in Python?",
          "options": {
            "A": "/* This is a comment */",
            "B": "",
            "C": "// This is a comment",
            "D": "# This is a comment"
          },
          "correct_answer": "D",
          "explanation": "The hash symbol (`#`) is the standard way to add single-line comments in Python. Everything written after the `#` on that line is considered a comment and is ignored by the Python interpreter during execution."
