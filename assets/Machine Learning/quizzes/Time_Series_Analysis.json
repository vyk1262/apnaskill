          "question": "What is the primary characteristic of time series data?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Data points are independent of each other.",
            "B": "Data points are recorded at regular or irregular intervals over time, and the order of the observations is important.",
            "C": "Data represents cross-sectional snapshots at a single point in time.",
            "D": "Data consists of categorical variables only."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The defining characteristic of **time series data** is that observations are collected over time, and their **order is crucial** because past values often influence future ones. This temporal dependency differentiates it from other data types."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are the main components often decomposed in time series analysis?",
          "options": {

          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Time series data is frequently decomposed into three underlying components: **Trend** (the long-term direction), **Seasonality** (repeating patterns over fixed periods), and **Residuals** (the irregular or random part remaining after removing trend and seasonality)."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the 'trend' component in a time series?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Short-term fluctuations in the data.",
            "B": "A long-term increase or decrease in the level of the time series.",

          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The **trend** component describes the general direction or overall movement of the time series over a long period. It can be an upward trend (growth), a downward trend (decline), or a relatively flat trend."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is 'seasonality' in a time series?",
          "options": {
            "A": "A long-term direction of the data.",
            "B": "Repetitive patterns that occur at fixed time intervals (e.g., daily, weekly, yearly).",
            "C": "Sudden, unexpected events in the data.",
            "D": "The average value of the time series."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "**Seasonality** refers to patterns that repeat over a fixed period, like daily cycles, weekly cycles, or annual cycles. For example, retail sales often exhibit seasonality, peaking during holidays."

        {
          "question": "What are 'residuals' (or 'noise') in time series decomposition?",
          "options": {
            "A": "The trend and seasonality components combined.",
            "B": "The long-term increasing or decreasing pattern.",

            "D": "The irregular or random fluctuations remaining after the trend and seasonality have been removed."
          },
          "correct_answer": "D",
          "explanation": "**Residuals** (also known as the irregular component or noise) are the unpredictable, random variations in the time series that are left over after the systematic components of trend and seasonality have been accounted for or removed."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is autocorrelation in time series analysis?",
          "options": {
            "A": "The correlation between different time series.",

          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "**Autocorrelation** measures the correlation between a time series's values at different points in time. Specifically, it's the correlation between an observation and another observation at a previous time step (a 'lagged' version of itself)."
        },
        {

          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "An **Autocorrelation Function (ACF) plot** displays the autocorrelation coefficients for a time series at various lags. It helps in identifying the presence of seasonality and the order of a Moving Average (MA) component in models."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plot?",
          "options": {

            "D": "A time series with no fluctuations."
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "A **stationary time series** is one whose statistical properties, such as mean, variance, and autocorrelation structure, remain constant over time. This means there's no trend, and the seasonal component is also constant."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why is stationarity often important in time series modeling?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Non-stationary time series are easier to model.",
            "B": "Many time series models assume stationarity for their theoretical properties to hold.",
            "C": "Stationary time series always have better forecasting accuracy.",
            "D": "Stationarity is only relevant for visualization."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "**Many traditional time series models (like ARIMA)** are based on the assumption that the data is stationary. If the data is non-stationary, these models can produce unreliable forecasts and statistical inferences. Therefore, transforming non-stationary data to stationary data is often a crucial preprocessing step."

          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "In an ARIMA(p, d, q) model: **p** is the order of the **Autoregressive (AR)** part, **d** is the degree of **differencing (I)** needed to make the series stationary, and **q** is the order of the **Moving Average (MA)** part."
        },
        {

          "explanation": "For **time series forecasting**, which typically involves predicting continuous numerical values, metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**, and **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** are commonly used to quantify the difference between predicted and actual values. The other options are for classification, regression explanation, or clustering."

          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Unlike typical machine learning tasks where random splitting is common, for **time series data**, it's crucial to maintain the **temporal order**. Therefore, the **train-test split is done chronologically**, with earlier data used for training and later data for testing, simulating real-world forecasting scenarios."

          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "**Time series analysis** is extensively applied in domains where data is collected sequentially over time. This includes predicting future values in finance (stock prices), meteorology (weather patterns), business (sales forecasting), and utilities (energy consumption)."
