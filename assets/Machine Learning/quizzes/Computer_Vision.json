        },
        {

            "C": "Segmenting an image into different regions.",
            "D": "Generating a new image based on a description."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "**Image classification** is the task of taking an input image and outputting a class or category label (e.g., 'dog', 'car', 'airplane') that best describes the entire image's content."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is object detection?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Assigning a label to an entire image.",
            "B": "Identifying and localizing specific objects within an image, often by drawing bounding boxes around them and assigning labels.",
            "C": "Enhancing the resolution of an image.",

          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The **convolution operation** is the fundamental building block of CNNs. It involves sliding a small matrix of learnable weights, called a **kernel** (or filter), over the input image. At each position, the kernel performs element-wise multiplication and summation, generating a single value in the **feature map** that highlights specific local patterns or features."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is a kernel (or filter) in a CNN?",
          "options": {

        },
        {
          "question": "What is a feature map in a CNN?",

          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "A **feature map** is the output of a convolutional layer. Each value in the feature map indicates the presence and strength of a specific feature (detected by the kernel) at a particular spatial location in the input image. As data passes through multiple convolutional layers, these feature maps represent increasingly complex and abstract features."

          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "A **pooling layer** (e.g., max pooling, average pooling) serves to **reduce the spatial dimensions (width and height) of the feature maps**. This helps to reduce the computational complexity, control overfitting, and make the detected features more invariant to small shifts or distortions in the input."
        },
        {

          "explanation": "The two most common types of pooling operations are **Max Pooling** (which takes the maximum value from each receptive field) and **Average Pooling** (which takes the average value). ReLU and Sigmoid are activation functions, convolution is an operation, and batch normalization/dropout are regularization techniques."
        },
        {

          "explanation": "After several convolutional and pooling layers have extracted hierarchical features, the flattened output is typically fed into one or more **fully connected layers**. These layers learn non-linear combinations of the high-level features and are responsible for performing the **final classification or regression task**."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is data augmentation in computer vision?",
          "options": {
            "A": "A technique for reducing the size of image datasets.",

            "D": "It is only useful for small datasets."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "**Data augmentation** is highly beneficial because it increases the diversity of the training data without collecting new images. This makes the model more robust to different viewpoints, lighting conditions, and orientations, thereby improving its **generalization ability** and reducing the likelihood of **overfitting** to the specific training examples."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are transfer learning and pre-trained models in computer vision?",

          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "**Transfer learning** is a machine learning technique where a model developed for a task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task. In computer vision, this often involves using a **pre-trained model** (a model already trained on a very large, generic dataset like ImageNet) and fine-tuning it for a specific, often smaller, new task."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why is transfer learning often effective in computer vision?",
          "options": {

            "B": "Pre-trained models have already learned general visual features that can be useful for various downstream tasks, reducing the need for large amounts of labeled data and extensive training.",
            "C": "It always makes the training process faster.",
            "D": "It simplifies the model architecture significantly."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "**Transfer learning is effective** because the features learned by models trained on vast datasets (like ImageNet's millions of diverse images) are highly generalizable. These models learn low-level features (edges, textures) and higher-level concepts that are relevant to many visual tasks. This significantly **reduces the need for large amounts of labeled data and extensive training time** for new tasks."

          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Despite significant progress, computer vision faces several inherent challenges. These include handling the wide array of natural variations in images: different **lighting conditions**, diverse **viewpoints**, varying **scales** of objects, **occlusion** (objects partially hidden), and complex **background clutter**, all of which can confuse a model."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are some ethical considerations in computer vision?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Only concerns about the accuracy of image recognition systems.",

          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Ethical concerns in computer vision are critical and span several areas. These include **bias** encoded in training data, which can lead to unfair or discriminatory performance (e.g., facial recognition systems performing poorly on certain demographics). **Privacy** concerns arise from the collection and processing of vast amounts of visual data. Finally, there's the potential for **misuse** in applications like mass surveillance or autonomous weapon systems, raising significant societal questions."
