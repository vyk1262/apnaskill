          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Modern model serving heavily relies on **cloud platforms** (which offer managed ML services), **containerization** for portability (Docker, Kubernetes for orchestration), and **specialized serving frameworks** (like TensorFlow Serving or TorchServe) built to efficiently host and serve ML models."
        },

          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "**Monitoring** of production ML models is crucial because models can degrade over time due to changes in data (data drift) or underlying relationships (concept drift). Monitoring helps detect these issues, track key performance metrics, identify system failures, and trigger necessary interventions like retraining."
        },
        {

          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "**Data drift** occurs when the statistical properties of the input data that the model receives in production change over time, diverging from the data distribution the model was trained on. This can significantly impact the model's accuracy and lead to performance degradation."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is 'model drift' (or 'concept drift')?",
          "options": {

          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "**Model drift**, also known as **concept drift**, refers to a change in the underlying relationship between the input features and the target variable. This means that the patterns the model learned during training are no longer valid, causing its predictions to become less accurate even if the input data distribution itself hasn't necessarily changed."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are some strategies for addressing model drift?",

          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "To combat model drift, effective strategies include **regularly retraining the model** on fresh, representative data, employing **online learning** approaches where the model continuously learns from new data, and maintaining **continuous monitoring** of key performance metrics to detect drift early."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is A/B testing in the context of deployed ML models?",

            "D": "Testing the model on different hardware configurations."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "**A/B testing** in ML deployment involves directing a portion of live user traffic to a new version of the model (Version B) while the remaining traffic goes to the current production model (Version A). By comparing key metrics (e.g., click-through rates, conversion rates), businesses can empirically determine if the new model is genuinely better before a full rollout."

            "D": "Deploying multiple models and randomly selecting one for each prediction."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "**Shadow deployment** (or canary deployment, a similar concept) involves deploying a new model version in parallel with the current production model, but without affecting live user predictions. The new model processes a copy of the live traffic, and its performance is monitored. This allows for testing in a real-world environment without risk to users, validating its stability and performance before gradually rolling it out to a larger audience."

            "D": "Minimizing any further interaction with the deployed model to reduce costs."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Maintaining ML models in production is an ongoing process that includes: **Regular monitoring** to track performance and detect anomalies; periodic **performance evaluation** against business metrics; systematic **retraining and updating** to adapt to data/concept drift; robust **infrastructure management** to ensure uptime and scalability; and a quick response system for **addressing issues or failures**."

            "B": "They focus on automating and streamlining the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle, including deployment, monitoring, and maintenance, to ensure efficient and reliable production systems.",
            "C": "They are primarily responsible for data collection and preprocessing.",
            "D": "They are only involved in the business aspects of machine learning applications."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "**DevOps** (Development Operations) and its specialized extension, **MLOps** (Machine Learning Operations), are critical for productionizing ML. They aim to automate and streamline the entire ML lifecycle, from data collection and model training to deployment, continuous monitoring, and maintenance. This ensures efficient, reliable, and scalable ML systems in production."

            "D": "The abundance of readily available expertise in this area."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Deploying and productionizing ML models presents several challenges: **infrastructure complexities** (setting up and managing servers, containers, orchestration), ensuring **scalability and reliability** under varying loads, actively **managing model drift** to maintain performance, and smoothly **integrating** the ML component into existing software ecosystems."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why is version control important for deployed machine learning models?",

            "B": "To manage different versions of the model, code, and configurations, allowing for rollback, reproducibility, and easier debugging.",
            "C": "To control access to the deployed model.",
            "D": "To optimize the model's performance."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "**Version control** is paramount for ML models in production. It allows teams to track every change to the model code, trained model artifacts, datasets, and configurations. This ensures **reproducibility** (being able to recreate previous states), facilitates **rollback** to stable versions if issues arise, and simplifies **debugging** by isolating changes."

            "D": "Mostly focused on the efficiency of the deployment infrastructure."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
