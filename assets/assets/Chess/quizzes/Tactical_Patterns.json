          },
          "correct_answer": "A",
          "explanation": "Forks are powerful tactics because the opponent can usually only save one of the attacked pieces."

          "options": {
            "A": "A move that restricts the movement of an opponent's piece because moving it would expose a more valuable piece (absolute pin) or the king (relative pin) to attack.",

            "C": "A defensive setup involving pawns.",

          },
          "correct_answer": "A",
          "explanation": "After the more valuable piece moves, the less valuable piece behind it can be captured."
