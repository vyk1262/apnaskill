        {
          "question": "What is the primary goal of 'Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting'?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To make AI models respond faster.",
            "B": "To encourage AI models to generate a series of intermediate reasoning steps before providing a final answer, improving accuracy on complex tasks.",
            "C": "To force AI models to use only pre-defined answers.",
            "D": "To reduce the amount of text in a prompt."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "CoT prompting guides the AI to 'think step-by-step', which is particularly effective for tasks requiring multi-step reasoning, logical inference, or problem-solving. This process mimics human thought processes."
        },
        {
          "question": "When is CoT prompting most beneficial?",
          "options": {
            "A": "For simple fact retrieval questions.",
            "B": "For complex reasoning tasks, mathematical problems, logical puzzles, or multi-step instructions.",
            "C": "When the AI model needs to generate creative fiction.",
            "D": "For summarization tasks."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "CoT prompting shines in scenarios where a direct answer is insufficient and the AI needs to demonstrate its reasoning process to arrive at the correct solution, especially for tasks that are difficult for standard zero-shot prompts."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the key mechanism used to induce CoT reasoning in a prompt?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Asking the AI to generate a random number.",
            "B": "Explicitly instructing the AI to 'think step by step', 'let's break this down', or providing examples of reasoning steps.",
            "C": "Providing only the final answer as an example.",
            "D": "Limiting the AI's response length."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The core of CoT is the explicit instruction to show the reasoning process. Phrases like 'Let's think step by step', 'Show your work', or providing examples of how the AI should reason are common."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are the two main types of CoT prompting?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Short-form and Long-form.",
            "B": "Zero-shot CoT and Few-shot CoT.",
            "C": "Simple CoT and Complex CoT.",

          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Zero-shot CoT uses a simple instruction like 'Let's think step by step' without examples. Few-shot CoT includes examples of reasoning steps along with the final answer."
        },
        {
          "question": "In 'Zero-shot CoT', what specific phrase is often appended to the prompt?",
          "options": {
            "A": "''Answer only with a single word.''",
            "B": "''Let's think step by step.''",
            "C": "''Provide a brief summary.''",
            "D": "''Translate to French.'' "
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The simple addition of 'Let's think step by step.' or similar phrases at the end of a prompt can surprisingly unlock the AI's ability to generate intermediate reasoning."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the advantage of 'Few-shot CoT' over 'Zero-shot CoT'?",
          "options": {
            "A": "It's always faster.",
            "B": "It provides the model with specific examples of the desired reasoning process, leading to more consistent and often more accurate results.",
            "C": "It requires less token usage.",
            "D": "It's simpler to implement."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "By showing the AI how to reason through examples, Few-shot CoT helps it learn the specific 'style' or 'logic' of reasoning required for a particular task, leading to superior performance on complex problems."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does CoT prompting help with 'explainability'?",
          "options": {
            "A": "It hides the AI's internal workings.",
            "B": "By showing the steps taken to reach a conclusion, CoT makes the AI's reasoning process more transparent and understandable to humans.",
            "C": "It only provides the final answer.",
            "D": "It uses complex mathematical formulas."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The generated 'chain of thought' serves as an audit trail or explanation of how the AI arrived at its answer, which is crucial for debugging, trust, and compliance in many applications."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can CoT prompting be applied to tasks beyond numerical reasoning?",
          "options": {
            "A": "No, it's only for math problems.",
            "B": "Yes, it can be applied to various tasks including logical deduction, complex text summarization, code generation, and strategic planning.",
            "C": "Only for simple text generation.",
            "D": "Only for single-step tasks."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",

        },
        {
          "question": "What is a potential downside of using CoT prompting?",
          "options": {
            "A": "It always provides incorrect answers.",
            "B": "It increases prompt length and therefore token usage, which can lead to higher costs and slower response times.",
            "C": "It makes the AI less intelligent.",
            "D": "It prevents the AI from learning new information."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Generating intermediate steps means more output from the AI, which translates to more tokens. This can incur higher API costs and slightly longer latency per query."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does CoT prompting relate to 'System 2 thinking' in AI?",
          "options": {
            "A": "It represents fast, intuitive thinking.",
            "B": "It encourages the AI to engage in more deliberate, sequential, and analytical reasoning, similar to System 2 thinking in cognitive science.",
            "C": "It's irrelevant to AI cognitive processes.",
            "D": "It only represents memorization."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Drawing parallels to Daniel Kahneman's 'Thinking, Fast and Slow', System 1 is intuitive and quick, while System 2 is slower, deliberate, and analytical. CoT prompting pushes the AI towards this more analytical, step-by-step processing."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is 'Self-consistency' in the context of CoT?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Generating only one chain of thought.",
            "B": "Generating multiple diverse chains of thought and then selecting the most consistent answer among them to improve robustness.",
            "C": "Ensuring the AI's response is always identical.",
            "D": "Limiting the AI's creativity."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Self-consistency is an advanced technique where the AI generates several possible CoT paths, and if they converge on the same answer, it increases confidence in that answer. If they diverge, it might indicate ambiguity or a difficult problem."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is 'Tree-of-Thought' (ToT) prompting, and how does it extend CoT?",
          "options": {
            "A": "A linear sequence of thoughts.",
            "B": "It explores multiple reasoning paths, branching out like a tree, allowing the AI to backtrack, explore alternatives, and prune unpromising paths, extending the linear CoT.",
            "C": "A method for visualizing CoT.",
            "D": "A simpler form of CoT."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "ToT is a more advanced reasoning technique where the AI doesn't just follow one linear path but explores a 'tree' of possible reasoning steps, evaluating options at each node, which can be more robust for highly complex problems."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can CoT prompting help reduce 'hallucinations' in AI responses?",
          "options": {
            "A": "No, it increases hallucinations.",
            "B": "By forcing the AI to demonstrate its reasoning, it can expose and reduce fabricated information as the logical steps become visible, making errors easier to spot.",
            "C": "It has no effect on hallucinations.",
            "D": "It only works for specific types of hallucinations."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "When an AI hallucinates, its reasoning path is often illogical or disconnected. CoT makes this flawed reasoning explicit, making it easier to identify and prompting the AI to self-correct or prompting the user to refine the prompt."
        },
        {
          "question": "When applying CoT, what is a crucial element to include if using the few-shot approach?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Only the final answer.",
            "B": "Both the problem and the step-by-step reasoning process leading to the correct answer for each example.",
            "C": "Only the reasoning steps without a problem.",
            "D": "Irrelevant information."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "For few-shot CoT to be effective, the AI needs to see not just the problem and answer, but *how* the answer was derived through explicit steps in the examples."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the typical output structure for a CoT prompt?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Only the final answer.",
            "B": "A detailed explanation of the reasoning, followed by the final answer.",
            "C": "A list of keywords.",
            "D": "A random sequence of words."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The essence of CoT is the intermediate steps. So, the output will typically show the AI's thinking process first, and then present the conclusion derived from that thinking."
        },
        {
          "question": "Does CoT prompting work with all AI models equally well?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Yes, it works universally.",
            "B": "No, it's generally more effective with larger, more capable language models that possess stronger reasoning abilities.",
            "C": "Only with small models.",
            "D": "Only with fine-tuned models."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "CoT relies on the AI's inherent reasoning capacity. Smaller models might struggle to generate coherent or accurate chains of thought, while larger, more powerful models benefit significantly."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can CoT prompting be combined with other prompt engineering techniques?",
          "options": {
            "A": "No, it must be used in isolation.",
            "B": "Yes, it can be combined with persona setting, output formatting, and specific instructions to achieve more complex and controlled reasoning outputs.",
            "C": "Only with zero-shot prompting.",
            "D": "Only with few-shot prompting."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "CoT is a pattern that enhances reasoning, and it can be layered with other patterns. For instance, you can ask an AI 'As a seasoned detective, let's think step by step to solve this mystery, providing your final conclusion in JSON format.' "
        },
        {
          "question": "What happens if a CoT prompt leads to an incorrect intermediate step?",
          "options": {
            "A": "The final answer will always be correct despite the error.",
            "B": "An incorrect intermediate step can propagate errors, leading to a flawed or incorrect final answer.",
            "C": "The AI automatically corrects itself without user intervention.",
            "D": "The AI will stop generating a response."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Like any chain of reasoning, a faulty link can break the entire chain. If the AI makes a mistake in an early step of its CoT, the final answer will likely be wrong."
        },
        {
          "question": "True or False: CoT prompting reduces the need for the AI model to access external knowledge.",
          "options": {
            "A": "True",
            "B": "False"
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "False. CoT prompting helps the AI *reason* more effectively with the knowledge it *already has* or with the context *provided in the prompt*. It does not reduce the need for factual knowledge; in fact, robust knowledge is often a prerequisite for sound reasoning."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the primary evaluation metric improved by CoT prompting on suitable tasks?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Response speed.",
            "B": "Accuracy or correctness of the final answer.",
            "C": "Creativity of the output.",
            "D": "Grammar and spelling."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The main benefit of CoT is that it allows the AI to perform better on tasks it would otherwise struggle with, leading to a higher rate of correct answers, especially in complex problem-solving scenarios."
