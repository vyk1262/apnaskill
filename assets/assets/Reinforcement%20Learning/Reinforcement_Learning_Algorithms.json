          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "Monte Carlo methods wait until the end of an episode to compute returns and use these returns to update value estimates or policy parameters."

          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "Bootstrapping is the hallmark of TD learning, where part of the update is based on an estimate rather than the true observed outcome."
        },
        {

          "options": {
            "A": "It uses a much larger learning rate.",
            "B": "It restricts the size of policy updates at each step, ensuring the new policy is not too far from the old one, thus preventing erratic behavior.",
