          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "RL's interactive, trial-and-error, and sequential nature with delayed rewards distinguishes it from supervised learning's direct error feedback on labeled data."

          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "The discount factor ensures that the agent prioritizes immediate rewards, preventing infinite returns in continuing tasks and reflecting the uncertainty of future rewards."

            "D": "The environment changes its rules frequently."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Episodic tasks have clear starting and ending points, like a game that finishes. Continuing tasks do not have natural termination."

          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "Model-free methods learn policies or value functions directly from experience, making them suitable when the environment's dynamics are unknown or too complex to model."

            "D": "Overfitting to training data."
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "Sparse and delayed rewards make it difficult for the agent to know which specific actions contributed to a positive or negative outcome, leading to the credit assignment problem."
        },

          "question": "Why is the concept of 'return' important in RL?",
          "options": {
            "A": "It's the immediate reward an agent receives.",
            "B": "It represents the total sum of discounted future rewards from a certain time step, which the agent aims to maximize.",
            "C": "It's the probability of reaching a terminal state.",
            "D": "It's a measure of the agent's computational efficiency."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The return (or cumulative discounted reward) is the quantity that the agent is actually trying to optimize over the long term, not just the immediate reward."
