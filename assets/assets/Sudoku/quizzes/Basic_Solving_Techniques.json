            "D": "Guessing."
          },
          "correct_answer": "A",
          "explanation": "This involves checking each empty cell to see which numbers from 1-9 are already present in its row, column, and 3x3 block, leaving only one possibility."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is 'Scanning' in Sudoku solving?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Quickly looking at the entire grid without focusing on specific cells.",
            "B": "Systematically checking rows, columns, and blocks for places where a specific number must go or cannot go.",
            "C": "Using a pencil to mark potential candidates in every empty cell.",

          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Scanning is a methodical way to apply the basic elimination rule."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is a 'Single Candidate' (or 'Forced Move') technique?",
          "options": {
            "A": "When an empty cell has only one possible number that can be placed in it according to the Sudoku rules.",
            "B": "When a row, column, or block has only one empty cell left.",
            "C": "When you have only one number left to place in the entire grid.",

          "question": "How do you identify a 'Single Candidate' in an empty cell?",
          "options": {
            "A": "By guessing a number and seeing if it fits.",
            "B": "By checking the numbers already present in the same row, column, and 3x3 block; if only one number from 1-9 is missing from all three, it's the single candidate.",
            "C": "By looking for patterns in the givens.",
            "D": "By using advanced solving techniques."
          },

          "question": "What is a 'Naked Single'?",
          "options": {
            "A": "A single given number in a row, column, or block.",
            "B": "An empty cell where, after eliminating all numbers present in its row, column, and block, only one possible candidate remains (same as Single Candidate/Forced Move).",
            "C": "A single empty cell that is not in the same row, column, or block as any other empty cells.",
            "D": "A single number that appears only once in the entire grid."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Naked Single is another term for a Single Candidate."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is a 'Hidden Single' technique?",
          "options": {
            "A": "A number that is hidden because it's written very small in a cell.",
            "B": "A number that is the only possible candidate for a specific cell within a row, column, or 3x3 block, even if other candidates might also be possible for that cell based on just its row, column, and block.",
            "C": "A single given number that is hard to see.",
            "D": "A number that appears only once in the solved puzzle."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Hidden Singles require looking within a row, column, or block to find a number that can only go in one specific empty cell within that unit."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do you find a 'Hidden Single' for a specific number (e.g., the number '4') within a row?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Look for the cell that seems most likely to contain a '4'.",
            "B": "Examine each empty cell in that row and see if '4' is a possible candidate. If '4' is a candidate for only one cell in that row, then '4' must go in that cell.",
            "C": "Look for rows that are missing only the number '4'.",
            "D": "Guess where the '4' might be hidden."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The '4' might also be a candidate in other cells in that row based on column and block constraints, but if it's uniquely possible in one cell *within that row*, it's a Hidden Single."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can 'Hidden Singles' occur in columns and 3x3 blocks as well as rows?",
          "options": {
            "A": "No, they only occur in rows.",
            "B": "Yes, the same logic applies to columns and 3x3 blocks; a number might be a candidate in multiple cells within that unit, but if it's the *only* cell in that unit where it can go, it's a Hidden Single.",
            "C": "Only in very easy puzzles.",
            "D": "Only in very hard puzzles."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The principle of Hidden Singles is fundamental to all three units of the Sudoku grid."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the relationship between 'Naked Singles' and 'Hidden Singles'?",
          "options": {
            "A": "They are the same thing.",
            "B": "A Naked Single is when an empty cell has only one possible candidate remaining. A Hidden Single is when a number is the only possible candidate for a cell within a row, column, or block, even if that cell has other candidates.",
            "C": "Naked Singles are easier to find than Hidden Singles.",
            "D": "Hidden Singles always lead to Naked Singles."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "They are distinct basic techniques that rely on different levels of analysis."

          "question": "When should you typically look for 'Hidden Singles' in your solving process?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Right at the beginning, before looking for Naked Singles.",
            "B": "After you have exhausted the 'Naked Singles' and need to make more deductions.",
            "C": "Only in very difficult puzzles.",
            "D": "Only when you are completely stuck."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Finding Naked Singles is often quicker initially, and then Hidden Singles can help to progress further."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the purpose of marking potential candidates (pencil marks) in empty cells?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To make the puzzle look more complicated.",
            "B": "To help visualize all the possible numbers for each empty cell, making it easier to spot Naked and Hidden Singles, as well as more advanced patterns later on.",
            "C": "To keep track of how many guesses you have made.",
            "D": "It's only useful for beginners."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Candidate marking is a valuable aid for more complex deductions."
        },
        {
          "question": "When marking candidates, which numbers should you consider for a specific empty cell?",
          "options": {
            "A": "All numbers from 1 to 9.",
            "B": "Only the numbers that are not already present in the same row.",
            "C": "Only the numbers that are not already present in the same column.",
            "D": "Only the numbers that are not already present in the same row, column, and 3x3 block."
          },
          "correct_answer": "D",
          "explanation": "Candidates are the numbers that *could* potentially go in a cell without immediately violating the rules."
        },
        {
          "question": "How can candidate marking help you find a 'Naked Single'?",
          "options": {
            "A": "It will highlight the cell where you should guess.",
            "B": "If an empty cell has only one candidate marked in it, then that number must be the Naked Single for that cell.",
            "C": "You need to erase all the other candidates to find the Naked Single.",
            "D": "It doesn't help with Naked Singles."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "A single remaining candidate directly identifies a Naked Single."
        },
        {
          "question": "How can candidate marking help you find a 'Hidden Single'?",
          "options": {
            "A": "It will automatically highlight Hidden Singles.",
            "B": "By looking within a row, column, or block, if a particular number appears as a candidate in only one empty cell within that unit, then that number is a Hidden Single for that cell.",
            "C": "You need to hide the other candidates to see the Hidden Single.",
            "D": "It's more difficult to find Hidden Singles with candidate marking."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",

          "question": "What is the next step in solving a Sudoku after you have found all the 'Naked Singles' and 'Hidden Singles' you can easily identify?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Start guessing.",
            "B": "Look for more advanced techniques like 'Pairs', 'Triples', etc.",

          "question": "Is there a specific order in which you should always apply the basic solving techniques?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Yes, always start with Hidden Singles.",
            "B": "Generally, it's efficient to look for Naked Singles first, as they are often the most direct deductions, followed by Hidden Singles.",
            "C": "The order doesn't matter as long as you use all of them.",
            "D": "You should alternate between them randomly."

          "options": {
            "A": "They are only used by beginners.",
            "B": "They rely on direct logical deduction from the Sudoku rules without needing to consider complex patterns or multiple possibilities simultaneously.",
