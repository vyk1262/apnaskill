        {
          "question": "What is the primary goal of data visualization?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To store large datasets efficiently.",
            "B": "To perform complex statistical calculations.",
            "C": "To communicate data insights effectively and clearly through visual representations.",
            "D": "To build predictive machine learning models."
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "The core purpose of data visualization is to make complex data understandable and accessible. By transforming data into visual forms like charts, graphs, and maps, it helps people quickly grasp patterns, trends, and outliers, leading to better insights and informed decisions. It's about clear and impactful communication, not storage, calculation, or modeling."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which type of chart is best suited for showing the distribution of a single numerical variable?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Scatter plot",
            "B": "Bar chart",
            "C": "Histogram",
            "D": "Pie chart"
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "A histogram displays the distribution of a single numerical variable by dividing its range into bins and showing how many data points fall into each bin. This allows for a quick understanding of the data's shape, spread, central tendency, and presence of outliers. Scatter plots show relationships between two numerical variables, bar charts compare categorical data, and pie charts show parts of a whole."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which type of chart is effective for comparing categorical data?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Line plot",
            "B": "Scatter plot",
            "C": "Bar chart",
            "D": "Histogram"
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "Bar charts are ideal for comparing quantities or frequencies across different categories. Each bar represents a category, and its length (or height) corresponds to the value of the variable for that category. Line plots are for trends over time, scatter plots for relationships between two numerical variables, and histograms for numerical distributions."
        },
        {
          "question": "What type of plot is useful for showing the relationship between two numerical variables?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Pie chart",
            "B": "Bar chart",
            "C": "Scatter plot",
            "D": "Histogram"
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "A scatter plot displays individual data points using two axes, where each axis represents one numerical variable. The pattern of the points reveals the relationship, correlation, or clustering between the two variables. Pie charts and bar charts are for categorical data, and histograms are for single numerical distributions."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which chart is commonly used to show trends over time?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Pie chart",
            "B": "Scatter plot",
            "C": "Line plot",
            "D": "Box plot"
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "A line plot is specifically designed to show how a numerical variable changes over a continuous period, typically time. The data points are connected by lines, making trends, seasonality, and overall progression easy to observe. Pie charts, scatter plots, and box plots serve different purposes."
        },
        {
          "question": "What type of chart is used to show parts of a whole?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Bar chart",
            "B": "Histogram",
            "C": "Scatter plot",
            "D": "Pie chart"
          },
          "correct_answer": "D",
          "explanation": "A pie chart represents parts of a whole, where each slice of the 'pie' corresponds to a proportion or percentage of the total. While widely used, they can be less effective for comparing many categories or small differences compared to other charts like stacked bar charts. Bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots serve other purposes."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is a box plot (boxplot) used for?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Showing trends over time.",
            "B": "Comparing categorical data.",
            "C": "Displaying the distribution of numerical data and identifying potential outliers.",
            "D": "Showing the relationship between two numerical variables."
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "A box plot (or box-and-whisker plot) provides a visual summary of the distribution of a numerical variable. It shows the median, quartiles (25th and 75th percentiles), and potential outliers, giving a clear picture of the data's central tendency, spread, and skewness."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is a heatmap commonly used to visualize?",
          "options": {
            "A": "The distribution of a single variable.",
            "B": "The correlation matrix between multiple variables.",
            "C": "Trends in time series data.",
            "D": "Categorical data proportions."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "A heatmap uses color-coding to represent the values in a matrix, making it excellent for visualizing correlation matrices. Each cell in the grid represents the correlation coefficient between two variables, and the intensity or shade of color indicates the strength and direction of the correlation."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are the key principles of effective data visualization?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Using as many colors and chart types as possible to make it visually appealing.",
            "B": "Clarity, accuracy, simplicity, and relevance to the audience.",
            "C": "Focusing solely on the aesthetic aspects of the visualization.",

          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Effective data visualizations are clear (easy to understand), accurate (represent data truthfully), simple (avoid unnecessary clutter), and relevant (address the audience's needs and the problem at hand). Overuse of colors or complex designs can hinder clarity, and hiding complexities can be misleading."
        },
        {
          "question": "What role does color play in data visualization?",
          "options": {
            "A": "It is purely for aesthetic purposes and does not convey information.",
            "B": "It can be used to represent different categories, magnitudes, or highlight specific data points.",
            "C": "It should always be used sparingly to avoid distraction.",
            "D": "It is only effective in pie charts."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Color is a powerful visual encoding channel. It can be used to differentiate categories (qualitative palettes), show magnitude (sequential or diverging palettes), draw attention to specific elements, or encode additional variables in a plot. Used thoughtfully, it enhances understanding; misused, it can mislead or confuse."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the importance of labels and annotations in data visualization?",
          "options": {
            "A": "They are unnecessary and clutter the visualization.",
            "B": "They provide context, explain elements, and make the visualization easier to understand.",
            "C": "They are only required for academic publications.",
            "D": "They should be cryptic to encourage closer inspection."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Labels (for axes, data points, legends) and annotations (explanatory text, arrows, highlights) are crucial for making a visualization self-explanatory. They add context, clarify what different elements represent, highlight key findings, and guide the viewer's interpretation, making the visualization more informative and less ambiguous."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which of the following is a common data visualization tool?",
          "options": {
