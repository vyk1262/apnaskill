          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The generator's goal is to produce convincing fake data that can fool the discriminator."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the primary role of the 'Discriminator' network in a GAN?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To generate new data samples.",

          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "Since the discriminator performs a binary classification (real/fake), binary crossentropy is the natural choice. The generator's loss is also derived from the discriminator's output, trying to make it output 'real' for fake samples."

            "B": "Only the generator is updated, the discriminator remains fixed.",
            "C": "They are updated alternately: one step for the discriminator, then one step for the generator (or similar cycles).",
            "D": "They are never updated; they are pre-trained."
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "Alternate training is crucial for the adversarial process to function, allowing each network to improve against the other."

          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "Mode collapse is a common challenge where the generator finds one or a few modes of the data distribution that fool the discriminator, ignoring other modes."

        {
          "question": "What does the discriminator's objective function aim to do?",
          "options": {

            "D": "GANs trained on very deep datasets."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "DCGANs introduced architectural guidelines for using CNNs effectively within GANs, leading to more stable training and higher quality image generation."

        {
          "question": "In a GAN, why is it problematic if the discriminator becomes too strong too early in training?",
          "options": {
            "A": "The generator will immediately produce perfect samples.",
            "B": "The generator's gradients will vanish, as the discriminator will always confidently classify fake samples as fake, providing little meaningful feedback for the generator to learn.",
            "C": "The training will converge too quickly.",
            "D": "It will lead to mode collapse."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "If the discriminator is perfect, its loss for fake samples will be very low, and its gradients will be near zero, making it difficult for the generator to learn how to improve."

            "B": "A GAN where the generation of samples is conditioned on some auxiliary information (e.g., class labels, text descriptions, or images).",
            "C": "A GAN that requires specific hardware conditions to run.",
            "D": "A GAN used only for conditional probability estimation."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "CGANs allow for control over the type of data being generated, rather than just random generation."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which problem with GAN training is 'WGAN (Wasserstein GAN)' designed to address?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Speeding up training time.",
            "B": "Reducing training instability and mode collapse, often by using a different loss function (Wasserstein distance) and weight clipping/gradient penalty.",
            "C": "Handling continuous data.",
            "D": "Generating higher resolution images directly."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "WGANs introduced the Wasserstein distance as a metric, which provides a more meaningful gradient for the generator, even when the discriminator is strong."
        },
        {
          "question": "True or False: The generator network in a GAN explicitly sees and uses the real training data during its own training updates.",
          "options": {
            "A": "True",
            "B": "False"
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "False. The generator's input is typically random noise. It learns to produce realistic data by observing the discriminator's feedback on the fake samples it generates."

          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The generator learns to map points in this latent space to meaningful data points in the output space."
        },
        {
          "question": "When building a GAN in Keras, how are the generator and discriminator models often combined for the generator's training step?",
          "options": {
            "A": "They are trained entirely separately.",
            "B": "A combined model is created where the generator's output is fed into the discriminator, and only the generator's weights are trainable.",
            "C": "The discriminator's weights are frozen, and the generator is trained on real data.",
            "D": "They are connected via a pooling layer."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "For the generator's training, you typically compile a `gan_model` that chains the generator and discriminator. Crucially, before compiling this `gan_model`, you set `discriminator.trainable = False` to ensure only the generator's weights are updated during this step."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which of the following is a potential ethical concern related to GANs?",
          "options": {
            "A": "They consume too much memory.",
            "B": "Their ability to create highly realistic 'deepfake' images or videos, raising concerns about misinformation and identity manipulation.",
            "C": "They are too slow for real-time applications.",
            "D": "They can only generate low-resolution images."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The photorealistic outputs of GANs have significant implications, both positive (e.g., creative art, data augmentation) and negative (e.g., misuse for malicious content)."
        },
        {
          "question": "What happens if the generator in a GAN becomes too strong too early in training?",
          "options": {
            "A": "The discriminator will become very good at its job.",
            "B": "The discriminator's loss will quickly go to zero, as it can't distinguish real from fake, providing no useful gradient to the generator.",
            "C": "It will always lead to mode collapse.",
            "D": "The training will instantly diverge."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "This is the opposite problem of the discriminator being too strong. If the discriminator can't learn, it can't give the generator a meaningful signal to improve."
        },
        {
          "question": "Applications of GANs include all of the following EXCEPT:",

          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "GANs are primarily for generative tasks, particularly with continuous data like images. Traditional rule-based expert systems do not typically use GANs for text generation."
