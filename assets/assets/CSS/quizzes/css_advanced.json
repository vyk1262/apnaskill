          },
          "correct_answer": "A",
          "explanation": "The `border-radius` property is a CSS3 feature that allows you to round the corners of an element's outer border edge."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which CSS property is used to apply an image as a border?",
          "options": {
            "A": "border-image",
            "B": "background-image",
            "C": "image-border",
            "D": "border-style"
          },
          "correct_answer": "A",
          "explanation": "The `border-image` property in CSS allows you to use an image as the border of an element, providing more flexible and creative border styles than solid colors."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which property is used to set the background color of an element?",
          "options": {

          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The `background-color` property specifically sets the solid color of an element's background. While `background` is a shorthand for multiple background properties, `background-color` is precise for just the color."
        },
        {
          "question": "What does the 'rgba' function stand for in CSS?",

            "B": "To control text opacity",
            "C": "To set the border color",
            "D": "To add a background image"
          },
          "correct_answer": "A",
          "explanation": "The `box-shadow` property applies one or more shadow effects to an element's box, allowing for customizability in terms of horizontal and vertical offset, blur radius, spread radius, and color."

            "D": "text-effect"
          },
          "correct_answer": "A",
          "explanation": "The `text-shadow` property applies one or more shadow effects to text. Similar to `box-shadow`, it allows defining offset, blur radius, and color for the shadow."
        },
        {

          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Web fonts (or `@font-face` rule) allow web designers to use custom fonts on their websites that are not necessarily installed on a user's computer. The browser downloads the font when needed, ensuring consistent typography across different systems."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which property is used to apply 2D transformations in CSS?",

          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The `transform` property is used for both 2D and 3D transformations. For 2D, functions like `translate()`, `rotate()`, `scale()`, and `skew()` are used within this property."
        },
        {
          "question": "What does the 'perspective' property affect in 3D transforms?",

          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The `perspective` property defines how deep the 3D scene is, essentially setting the **distance from the viewer to the z=0 plane**. A smaller value creates a more intense 3D effect, making elements appear closer or further away."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which CSS property allows you to animate changes to CSS properties?",
          "options": {

            "D": "effect"
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The `transition` property provides a way to control the animation speed when a CSS property changes from one value to another. It creates a smooth animation effect rather than an abrupt change."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which property is used to define a CSS animation's duration?",
          "options": {
            "A": "animation-time",

            "C": "To control the size of fonts",
            "D": "To set the color of an object"
          },
          "correct_answer": "A",
          "explanation": "The `object-fit` property is used to specify how the content of a replaced element (like `<img>` or `<video>`) should be resized to fit its container, such as `fill`, `contain`, `cover`, `none`, or `scale-down`."

            "C": "Using 'filter: reflect' property",
            "D": "CSS does not support reflections"
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "While CSS doesn't have a direct `reflection` property, reflections can be achieved using the `-webkit-box-reflect` property (for WebKit browsers) or by combining CSS gradients and transforms to simulate the effect. The `filter` property, specifically using `filter: reflect()`, is not a standard or direct way to create reflections across browsers."
        },
        {
          "question": "What does the 'masking' property in CSS do?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Hides an element completely",

            "D": "Adds a border to an element"
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "CSS masking allows you to selectively show or hide parts of an element using an image or a gradient as a mask. This is similar to clipping, but offers more flexibility in terms of transparency and complex shapes."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which CSS property is used to set custom variables?",
          "options": {
            "A": "--variable-name",

            "D": "custom-property"
          },
          "correct_answer": "A",
          "explanation": "CSS Custom Properties (often called CSS variables) are defined with a double-hyphen prefix, like `--variable-name: value;`. They allow you to define reusable values that can be used throughout your stylesheets, improving maintainability and consistency. The `var()` function is used to *access* these variables."

          },
          "correct_answer": "A",
          "explanation": "The `@property` CSS at-rule allows you to explicitly define custom properties and their syntax, initial value, and inheritance behavior. This makes custom properties more robust and enables them to be animated or transitioned smoothly."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the purpose of media queries in CSS?",
          "options": {

            "C": "To manage font sizes",
            "D": "To create gradients"
          },
          "correct_answer": "A",
          "explanation": "Media queries are a fundamental part of Responsive Web Design.

            "D": "Creating background images"
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout module) is a one-dimensional layout method in CSS designed for **aligning and distributing space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown or dynamic**. It's ideal for distributing items in a single row or column."
