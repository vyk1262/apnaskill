      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "What is the primary purpose of a Dockerfile?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To define the network configuration for a Docker Swarm.",
            "B": "To automate the process of building a Docker image layer by layer.",
            "C": "To manage persistent data storage for containers.",
            "D": "To monitor the health of running Docker containers."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "A Dockerfile is a plain text file that contains a series of instructions and arguments used to automatically build a Docker image. Each instruction creates a new layer in the image, promoting efficiency and reproducibility."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which instruction in a Dockerfile specifies the base image for a new image?",
          "options": {
            "A": "`RUN`",
            "B": "`CMD`",
            "C": "`FROM`",
            "D": "`COPY`"
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "The `FROM` instruction is always the first non-comment instruction in a Dockerfile. It specifies the base image (e.g., `ubuntu:latest`, `node:16`) upon which your new image will be built."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the `RUN` instruction used for in a Dockerfile?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To execute a command when the container starts.",
            "B": "To define the entry point for the container.",
            "C": "To execute commands during the image build process, creating a new layer.",
            "D": "To copy files from the host to the container."
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "The `RUN` instruction executes commands in a new layer on top of the current image, and commits the results. This is used for installing packages, compiling code, creating directories, and other build-time operations."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the difference between `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` in a Dockerfile?",
          "options": {
            "A": "`CMD` is executed at build time, `ENTRYPOINT` at runtime.",
            "B": "`CMD` sets the default command that can be overridden, `ENTRYPOINT` sets the fixed command that is always executed.",
            "C": "`ENTRYPOINT` sets the default command that can be overridden, `CMD` sets the fixed command.",
            "D": "They are interchangeable and serve the same purpose."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "`CMD` defines the default command or arguments for a container, which can be easily overridden by arguments passed to `docker run`. `ENTRYPOINT` defines the main executable that is always run when a container starts, and any `CMD` arguments are appended to it. This makes `ENTRYPOINT` suitable for wrapping an executable."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which instruction is used to copy files or directories from the build context to the image?",
          "options": {
            "A": "`ADD`",
            "B": "`MOUNT`",
            "C": "`UPLOAD`",
            "D": "`INSERT`"
          },
          "correct_answer": "A",
          "explanation": "The `ADD` instruction copies new files, directories, or remote file URLs from `<src>` and adds them to the filesystem of the image at path `<dest>`. It also has the ability to automatically extract compressed archives (tar, gzip, bzip2) if the source is a local tar archive."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the primary difference between `COPY` and `ADD` instructions in a Dockerfile?",
          "options": {
            "A": "`COPY` copies from URL, `ADD` copies from local filesystem.",
            "B": "`ADD` can automatically extract compressed files and handle remote URLs, `COPY` only copies local files/directories.",
            "C": "`COPY` creates a new layer, `ADD` does not.",
            "D": "They are functionally identical in all scenarios."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "`COPY` is a simpler instruction that only copies local files or directories. `ADD` has additional capabilities: it can handle remote URLs and can automatically extract compressed archives (like tarballs) if the source is a local compressed file. For general copying of local files, `COPY` is generally preferred for clarity."
        },
        {
          "question": "What does the `WORKDIR` instruction do in a Dockerfile?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Sets the working directory on the host machine.",
            "B": "Sets the working directory for subsequent `RUN`, `CMD`, `ENTRYPOINT`, `COPY`, and `ADD` instructions within the image.",
            "C": "Defines the user to run commands as.",
            "D": "Exposes network ports."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The `WORKDIR` instruction sets the working directory for any `RUN`, `CMD`, `ENTRYPOINT`, `COPY`, or `ADD` instructions that follow it in the Dockerfile. It makes it easier to manage paths within the container's filesystem."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why is it recommended to place frequently changing instructions (like `COPY . .`) later in a Dockerfile?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To make the Dockerfile easier to read.",
            "B": "To ensure the image is smaller.",
            "C": "To leverage Docker's build cache and speed up subsequent builds.",
            "D": "It has no impact on build performance."
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "Docker builds images layer by layer and caches each layer. If an instruction (and its context) hasn't changed, Docker can use the cached layer, skipping subsequent instructions until it hits a changed instruction. By placing frequently changing parts (like application code) later, you maximize the chance of reusing earlier, more stable layers (like base OS and dependencies), speeding up builds."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the build context when building a Docker image?",
          "options": {
            "A": "The contents of the Dockerfile itself.",
            "B": "The Docker Hub repository where the image will be pushed.",
            "C": "The set of files and directories at the `PATH` or `URL` specified in the `docker build` command.",
            "D": "The operating system of the Docker host."
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "The build context is the set of files and directories that Docker sends to the Docker daemon when you run `docker build`. This is typically the directory where your Dockerfile is located. Only files within this context can be referenced by `COPY` or `ADD` instructions."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which instruction is used to expose ports from the container at runtime?",
          "options": {
            "A": "`PORT`",
            "B": "`LISTEN`",
            "C": "`EXPOSE`",
            "D": "`PUBLISH`"
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "The `EXPOSE` instruction informs Docker that the container will listen on the specified network ports at runtime. It serves as documentation and does not actually publish the ports to the host; for that, you need to use the `-p` or `--publish` flag with `docker run`."
        },
        {
          "question": "How can you specify a custom name and tag for a Docker image during the build process?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Using the `-n` flag with `docker build`.",
            "B": "Using the `-t` or `--tag` flag with `docker build`.",
            "C": "By modifying the `FROM` instruction in the Dockerfile.",
            "D": "It's done after the build is complete."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The `-t` or `--tag` flag with `docker build` allows you to give a name and optionally a tag (e.g., `my-app:1.0` or `my-app:latest`) to the resulting image. This makes it easy to identify and reference your images."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the purpose of `.dockerignore` file?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To specify which Docker images to ignore during local listing.",
            "B": "To list files and directories that should be included in the build context.",
            "C": "To exclude specific files and directories from being sent to the Docker daemon during the build process.",
            "D": "To define environment variables that should be ignored by the container."
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "Similar to `.gitignore`, a `.dockerignore` file specifies patterns of files and directories that should be excluded from the build context. This helps to speed up the build process by reducing the amount of data sent to the daemon and keeps the final image smaller by not including unnecessary files."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which instruction is used to set environment variables inside a Docker image?",
          "options": {
            "A": "`SETENV`",
            "B": "`ENV`",
            "C": "`VAR`",
            "D": "`DEFINE`"
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The `ENV` instruction sets environment variables within the Docker image. These variables will be available to all subsequent instructions in the Dockerfile and also to processes running inside the container when it's started."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the recommended practice for installing multiple packages in a single `RUN` instruction?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Use a separate `RUN` instruction for each package to leverage caching.",
            "B": "Combine multiple commands using `&&` to reduce the number of layers.",
            "C": "Install packages one by one in interactive mode.",
            "D": "It doesn't matter how you install them."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Combining multiple commands (like `apt-get update && apt-get install -y package1 package2`) into a single `RUN` instruction with `&&` is a best practice. This minimizes the number of layers created in the image, leading to smaller image sizes and fewer potential vulnerabilities from intermediate layers."
        },
        {
          "question": "What happens if a `RUN` instruction fails during a Docker image build?",
          "options": {
            "A": "The build continues, but the image will be marked as incomplete.",
            "B": "The build process fails and stops at that instruction.",
            "C": "Docker automatically attempts to fix the error and retries.",
            "D": "The failed instruction is skipped, and the build proceeds to the next one."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "If a `RUN` instruction (or any other instruction) fails during the Docker image build, the entire build process stops immediately. Docker will report the error, and you will need to fix the issue in your Dockerfile before attempting to build the image again."
        },
        {
          "question": "How can you specify a custom Dockerfile name or path when building an image?",
          "options": {
            "A": "`docker build --file-name mydockerfile .`",
            "B": "`docker build -f /path/to/my/Dockerfile .`",
            "C": "`docker build -d mydockerfile .`",
            "D": "You cannot use a custom Dockerfile name; it must always be `Dockerfile`."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The `-f` or `--file` flag with `docker build` allows you to specify a different name or path for your Dockerfile if it's not named `Dockerfile` or is not in the current build context directory."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which instruction specifies the user or UID to run subsequent commands and the entrypoint/cmd?",
          "options": {
            "A": "`GROUP`",
            "B": "`CHOWN`",
            "C": "`USER`",
            "D": "`AUTHOR`"
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "The `USER` instruction sets the user name or UID to use when running the image and for any `RUN`, `CMD`, or `ENTRYPOINT` instructions that follow it. This is a crucial security practice to avoid running applications as the root user inside the container."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the advantage of using multi-stage builds in Dockerfiles?",
          "options": {
            "A": "They allow a single Dockerfile to build multiple unrelated images.",
            "B": "They enable better network performance for containers.",
            "C": "They help to create smaller, more secure production images by separating build-time dependencies from runtime dependencies.",
            "D": "They automate the deployment of containers to a Swarm cluster."
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "Multi-stage builds allow you to use multiple `FROM` statements in your Dockerfile. Each `FROM` instruction can start a new stage. You can then selectively copy artifacts from one stage to another, effectively discarding all the build tools and intermediate files from the final production image. This results in significantly smaller and more secure images."
        },
        {
          "question": "If you have a Dockerfile and want to build an image named 'my-app' with tag 'v1.0' from the current directory, what command would you use?",
          "options": {
            "A": "`docker run -t my-app:v1.0 .`",
            "B": "`docker build -f Dockerfile my-app:v1.0`",
            "C": "`docker build -t my-app:v1.0 .`",
            "D": "`docker create my-app:v1.0`"
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "The `docker build` command is used for building images. The `-t` flag specifies the tag (name and version) for the image, and the `.` at the end indicates that the build context is the current directory, where the Dockerfile is expected to reside."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the purpose of the `HEALTHCHECK` instruction in a Dockerfile?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To verify the Dockerfile syntax during build time.",
            "B": "To run a command inside the container to check if it's running correctly and responsive.",
            "C": "To optimize the image size by removing unnecessary layers.",
            "D": "To perform a security scan on the image vulnerabilities."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The `HEALTHCHECK` instruction tells Docker how to test a container to check if it's still working. This can be used by orchestration systems (like Docker Swarm or Kubernetes) to detect and react to unresponsive containers, leading to more robust deployments."
