      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "What is the primary role of an orchestrator (e.g., Docker Swarm, Kubernetes) in a production Docker environment?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To build Docker images automatically.",
            "B": "To manage the deployment, scaling, networking, and availability of containerized applications across a cluster of machines.",
            "C": "To provide a GUI for managing Docker.",
            "D": "To scan images for security vulnerabilities."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Orchestrators are essential in production to automate the operational tasks of managing large-scale containerized applications. They handle tasks like scheduling containers, scaling services up/down, load balancing traffic, self-healing from failures, and managing network connectivity across multiple hosts."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why is high availability crucial for Docker deployments in production, and how is it typically achieved?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To reduce network latency; achieved by using faster internet.",
            "B": "To ensure applications remain accessible even if a host or container fails; achieved through replication and orchestrators.",
            "C": "To minimize disk space usage; achieved by deleting old images.",
            "D": "To speed up image pulls; achieved by using a local registry."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "High availability means applications are always available, even in the event of failures. In Docker, this is achieved by running multiple replicas of services across different nodes in a cluster, managed by an orchestrator that can automatically restart failed containers or reschedule them on healthy nodes."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the importance of a centralized logging system (e.g., ELK Stack, Splunk) for Docker in production?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To reduce container resource usage.",
            "B": "To collect, aggregate, and analyze logs from all running containers, enabling monitoring, debugging, and auditing.",
            "C": "To encrypt container data.",
            "D": "To automatically apply security patches to containers."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Containers generate logs that are often volatile. A centralized logging system collects these logs from all containers across the cluster, making it possible to search, filter, analyze, and troubleshoot issues effectively, especially in distributed environments."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is a 'rolling update' in the context of production Docker deployments?",
          "options": {
            "A": "A method to update Docker daemon software.",
            "B": "A deployment strategy where new versions of a service are gradually rolled out, replacing old versions without downtime.",
            "C": "A process of reverting to an older image version.",
            "D": "A way to automatically scale containers."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Rolling updates are a common strategy for zero-downtime deployments. Orchestrators replace old container instances with new ones incrementally, ensuring that the application remains available throughout the update process. This is crucial for continuous delivery in production."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why are health checks (e.g., `HEALTHCHECK` in Dockerfile) crucial for production services?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To verify the integrity of the Docker image.",
            "B": "To allow the orchestrator to determine if a container's application is truly ready and responsive, enabling proper traffic routing and self-healing.",
            "C": "To measure the network latency of the container.",
            "D": "To automatically scale the service based on load."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "A container might be 'running' but its application inside could be frozen or unresponsive. Health checks provide a mechanism for Docker and orchestrators to periodically query the application's health. If a container fails its health checks, the orchestrator knows to replace it, ensuring only healthy instances receive traffic."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the significance of using 'immutable infrastructure' principles with Docker in production?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To prevent containers from being removed.",
            "B": "To treat containers and their underlying infrastructure as never changing after deployment; updates involve deploying new, patched images/containers rather than modifying existing ones.",
            "C": "To ensure containers are always run as root.",
            "D": "To avoid using volumes for persistent data."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Immutable infrastructure means that once a component (like a Docker container) is deployed, it is never modified. For updates or changes, a new version of the component is built and deployed, replacing the old one. This increases predictability, reduces configuration drift, and simplifies rollbacks."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is a common strategy for managing secrets (e.g., database passwords, API keys) in a production Docker environment?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Hardcoding them directly in Dockerfiles.",
            "B": "Passing them as environment variables directly in `docker run` commands.",
            "C": "Using Docker Secrets, Kubernetes Secrets, or dedicated secret management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault).",
            "D": "Storing them in a publicly accessible Git repository."
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "Sensitive data should never be hardcoded in images or passed as plaintext environment variables. Secure secret management solutions (like Docker Secrets built into Swarm, Kubernetes Secrets, or external tools) encrypt and inject secrets into containers at runtime securely, minimizing exposure."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why is monitoring (metrics and alerts) essential for Dockerized applications in production?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To prevent unauthorized access to containers.",
            "B": "To gain insights into application and infrastructure performance, detect anomalies, and proactively respond to issues before they impact users.",
            "C": "To reduce the size of Docker images.",
            "D": "To automate container scaling without human intervention."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog) collect metrics (CPU, memory, network, application-specific data) from containers and the host. This data is vital for understanding system health, identifying bottlenecks, debugging, and setting up alerts for abnormal behavior."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the role of a reverse proxy/load balancer (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy, Traefik) in a production Docker setup?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To store Docker images.",
            "B": "To distribute incoming network traffic across multiple container instances of a service, providing high availability and efficient resource utilization.",
            "C": "To manage persistent storage for containers.",
            "D": "To build Docker images dynamically."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "A reverse proxy/load balancer sits in front of your containerized application services. It receives external requests and forwards them to one of the healthy instances of your service, balancing the load and ensuring that if one instance fails, traffic is redirected to others."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is `docker-compose.prod.yml` an example of, and why is it used?",
          "options": {
            "A": "A file for local development configuration.",
            "B": "A separate Docker Compose file used to define production-specific configurations that override or extend the base `docker-compose.yml`.",
            "C": "A file for database migrations.",
            "D": "A file to define network settings only."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "It's a common practice to have different Compose files for different environments (e.g., `docker-compose.yml` for development, `docker-compose.prod.yml` for production). The production file might include configurations like specific `image` tags, restart policies, resource limits, logging drivers, and replica counts suitable for production, overriding default development settings."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why is it important to implement robust backup and disaster recovery strategies for Docker volumes in production?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To make images smaller.",
            "B": "To ensure that persistent application data is not lost in the event of host failure, accidental deletion, or corruption.",
            "C": "To speed up container startup times.",
            "D": "To encrypt all network traffic."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "While Docker volumes persist data independent of the container, they are still tied to the host's underlying storage. Without proper backup and disaster recovery, data loss can occur. Strategies include backing up volumes to remote storage, using cloud-managed volumes with replication, or leveraging storage plugins."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is a 'registry mirror' commonly used for in a production environment?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To push images to multiple registries simultaneously.",
            "B": "To cache Docker images locally, speeding up image pulls and reducing bandwidth usage for frequently accessed images.",
            "C": "To verify image signatures.",
            "D": "To monitor registry uptime."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "In production, especially with many hosts or frequent deployments, repeatedly pulling images from a remote registry can consume significant bandwidth and time. A local registry mirror caches images, making subsequent pulls much faster and more reliable for your internal network."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the importance of continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines for Docker in production?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To manually deploy containers to production.",
            "B": "To automate the entire software delivery process, from code commit to building, testing, and deploying Docker images to production, ensuring speed, consistency, and reliability.",
            "C": "To restrict network access to containers.",
            "D": "To manage Docker daemon configurations."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "CI/CD pipelines automate the build, test, and deployment of containerized applications. This reduces human error, speeds up releases, and ensures that only tested and validated images reach production. For Docker, this involves automating Dockerfile builds, image tagging, vulnerability scanning, and deployment to orchestrators."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why should you limit resource consumption (CPU, memory) for containers in production?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To make the Docker daemon run faster.",
            "B": "To prevent a single misbehaving or compromised container from consuming all host resources, potentially causing a denial of service for other containers or the host itself.",
            "C": "To increase network throughput.",
            "D": "To enable remote debugging."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Resource limits (using cgroups in Docker, or specific settings in orchestrators) are crucial. They prevent a 'noisy neighbor' problem where one container hogs all CPU or memory, impacting the performance and stability of other containers and the entire host system."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is a 'blue/green deployment' strategy in production, often used with Docker?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Deploying only blue containers on Monday and green on Tuesday.",
            "B": "A strategy involving two identical production environments (blue and green). New code is deployed to the inactive 'green' environment, tested, and then traffic is switched from 'blue' to 'green' for zero-downtime updates.",
            "C": "A method to reduce memory consumption.",
            "D": "A strategy for encrypting network traffic."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Blue/Green deployment minimizes downtime and risk by having two identical production environments. The 'blue' is currently active, and the 'green' is inactive. New code is deployed to 'green', tested thoroughly, and then traffic is instantly switched. If issues arise, traffic can be instantly switched back to 'blue'."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the purpose of a Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin in a production Kubernetes/Swarm environment?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To manage container storage.",
            "B": "To provide advanced networking capabilities, like overlay networks, network policies, and IP address management, across multiple nodes.",
            "C": "To build Docker images.",
            "D": "To monitor container resource usage."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "CNI is a standard for configuring network interfaces for Linux containers. Orchestrators like Kubernetes and Docker Swarm use CNI-compliant plugins (e.g., Calico, Flannel, Weave Net) to implement sophisticated multi-host networking, including network policies for security and advanced IP address management."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why is regular vulnerability scanning of Docker images important in production?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To optimize image download speeds.",
            "B": "To identify and remediate known security vulnerabilities in the base image, libraries, and application dependencies, both before deployment and continuously.",
            "C": "To ensure image compatibility with older Docker versions.",
            "D": "To verify the integrity of the Dockerfile."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Vulnerabilities are constantly discovered. Regularly scanning images (e.g., using Snyk, Clair, Trivy) in your CI/CD pipeline and even in production registries ensures that you identify and address security flaws in your containerized applications promptly, reducing the risk of exploitation."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is a typical consideration for 'stateful' applications (e.g., databases) when containerizing for production?",
          "options": {
            "A": "They should always run without any persistent storage.",
            "B": "They require robust external persistent storage solutions (e.g., shared volumes, cloud databases, stateful sets in Kubernetes) to ensure data durability and availability independent of the container's lifecycle.",
            "C": "They can only run on single-node Docker hosts.",
            "D": "They don't need network access."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Stateful applications store data that must persist across container restarts or replacements. For production, simply using local Docker volumes on a single host is often insufficient. Distributed storage solutions, managed database services, or orchestrator-specific constructs (like Kubernetes StatefulSets) are used to ensure data durability, replication, and backup."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the purpose of 'readiness probes' in a production orchestration environment (e.g., Kubernetes)?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To check if the container image exists.",
            "B": "To determine if a container is ready to accept incoming traffic.",
            "C": "To test the network latency between containers.",
            "D": "To check if the Docker daemon is running."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Readiness probes (distinct from health checks) tell the orchestrator when a container's application is *ready* to serve requests. A container might be healthy (running) but not yet ready (e.g., still loading data). The orchestrator will only direct traffic to containers that pass their readiness probes."
        },
        {
          "question": "True or False: Using the `--restart always` policy is sufficient for production-grade high availability without an orchestrator.",
          "options": {
            "A": "True",
            "B": "False"
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "False. While `--restart always` helps keep a single container running on a single host, it does not provide true high availability. If the host machine itself fails, or if the application needs to scale across multiple hosts, or requires complex rolling updates, a dedicated orchestrator (like Docker Swarm or Kubernetes) is absolutely necessary."
