        {
          "question": "What is the core idea behind reinforcement learning?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Learning from labeled data to predict future outcomes.",
            "B": "Learning patterns from unlabeled data.",
            "C": "Learning through trial and error by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.",
            "D": "Learning to classify data into predefined categories based on labeled examples."
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a paradigm where an **agent learns to make decisions** by performing actions in an **environment**. It receives **feedback in the form of rewards or penalties**, which it uses to learn an optimal strategy to maximize cumulative reward over time."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are the key components of a reinforcement learning framework?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Features and labels.",
            "B": "Clusters and centroids.",
            "C": "Agent, environment, state, action, reward, and policy.",
            "D": "Generator and discriminator."
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "The fundamental components of an RL system are the **Agent** (the learner), the **Environment** (what the agent interacts with), **State** (the agent's observation of the environment), **Action** (the agent's decision), **Reward** (feedback from the environment), and **Policy** (the strategy the agent follows)."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the role of the 'agent' in reinforcement learning?",
          "options": {
            "A": "The physical or virtual space in which the learning occurs.",
            "B": "The set of rules that define how the environment changes.",
            "C": "The learner that makes decisions and takes actions in the environment.",
            "D": "The signal that indicates the desirability of an action."
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "The **agent** is the intelligent entity in the RL framework. It's the part that observes the environment, makes decisions (chooses actions), and learns from the feedback (rewards) it receives."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the 'environment' in reinforcement learning?",
          "options": {
            "A": "The decision-making entity.",
            "B": "The set of all possible actions the agent can take.",
            "C": "The external system with which the agent interacts.",
            "D": "The function that maps states to actions."
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "The **environment** is everything outside the agent. It receives actions from the agent, changes its state accordingly, and sends new observations and rewards back to the agent."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is a 'state' in reinforcement learning?",
          "options": {
            "A": "A specific action taken by the agent.",
            "B": "A representation of the environment at a particular point in time.",
            "C": "The reward received after taking an action.",
            "D": "The overall goal of the agent."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "A **state** is a complete or partial description of the current situation of the environment at a given moment. It provides the agent with the necessary information to decide on its next action."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is an 'action' in reinforcement learning?",
          "options": {
            "A": "The current condition of the environment.",
            "B": "A choice made by the agent in a given state.",
            "C": "The numerical feedback from the environment.",
            "D": "The strategy used by the agent to choose actions."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "An **action** is a choice or decision made by the agent at a specific state. When the agent takes an action, the environment transitions to a new state and provides a reward."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is a 'reward' in reinforcement learning?",
          "options": {
            "A": "The agent's current understanding of the environment.",
            "B": "A scalar signal that the environment provides to the agent after an action, indicating its desirability.",
            "C": "The sequence of states and actions taken by the agent.",
            "D": "The function that determines the optimal action in each state."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The **reward** is a crucial feedback mechanism. It's a numerical value (positive for good actions, negative for bad) that the environment sends to the agent, guiding its learning towards desired behaviors."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is a 'policy' in reinforcement learning?",
          "options": {
            "A": "The environment's response to the agent's actions.",
            "B": "A mapping from states to actions that the agent uses to decide what to do.",
            "C": "The total reward accumulated by the agent over time.",
            "D": "The process of updating the agent's knowledge."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "A **policy** defines the agent's behavior. It's a strategy that specifies which action to take in any given state, either deterministically (always the same action) or stochastically (a probability distribution over actions)."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the difference between 'episodic' and 'continuing' tasks in reinforcement learning?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Episodic tasks have a terminal state, while continuing tasks do not.",
            "B": "Continuing tasks involve discrete action spaces, while episodic tasks involve continuous action spaces.",
            "C": "Episodic tasks are simpler than continuing tasks.",
            "D": "There is no fundamental difference between them."
          },
          "correct_answer": "A",
          "explanation": "**Episodic tasks** are those that have a clear beginning and end (a terminal state), like playing a game or finishing a maze. **Continuing tasks** have no natural ending; the interaction continues indefinitely, such as controlling a robot or managing a power plant."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the goal of the agent in reinforcement learning?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To memorize all possible state-action pairs.",
            "B": "To learn a policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward over time.",
            "C": "To always take random actions to explore the environment.",
            "D": "To reach a specific target state as quickly as possible, regardless of the rewards."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The ultimate goal of a reinforcement learning agent is to learn an optimal **policy** that allows it to choose actions in each state such that the **total expected cumulative reward** over the long run is maximized."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the exploration-exploitation dilemma in reinforcement learning?",
          "options": {
            "A": "The choice between using discrete or continuous action spaces.",
            "B": "The challenge of balancing between trying new actions to discover potentially better policies (exploration) and choosing actions that are known to yield good rewards (exploitation).",
            "C": "The difficulty of defining a suitable reward function.",
            "D": "The problem of dealing with large state spaces."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The **exploration-exploitation dilemma** is a core challenge in RL. The agent must decide whether to **explore** (try new actions to discover more about the environment and potentially find better rewards) or **exploit** (choose actions that have historically yielded the best rewards). A good balance is essential for effective learning."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is a 'value function' in reinforcement learning?",
          "options": {
            "A": "A function that maps states to actions.",
            "B": "A function that estimates the expected future reward starting from a particular state (state value) or a state-action pair (action value).",
            "C": "The policy that the agent follows.",
            "D": "The immediate reward received after an action."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "A **value function** provides an estimate of how good a particular state or state-action pair is in terms of the total expected future reward. It's a way for the agent to assess the long-term desirability of being in a state or taking an action from a state."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the difference between 'model-based' and 'model-free' reinforcement learning?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Model-based RL uses a model of the environment to plan actions, while model-free RL learns directly from experience without explicitly modeling the environment.",

            "C": "Model-based RL is only applicable to discrete state and action spaces.",
            "D": "There is no significant difference between them."
          },
          "correct_answer": "A",
          "explanation": "**Model-based RL** algorithms learn or are given a model of the environment (how states transition and rewards are received) and use it for planning. **Model-free RL** algorithms learn directly from trials and errors, without building an explicit model of the environment dynamics."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which of the following is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm?",
          "options": {

            "D": "Dynamic Programming"
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "**Q-learning** is a classic example of a **model-free** reinforcement learning algorithm. It learns the optimal action-value function directly from interactions with the environment, without needing an explicit model of the environment's dynamics. Value Iteration, Policy Iteration, and Dynamic Programming are typically model-based methods."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is 'Q-learning'?",

          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "**Q-learning** is a popular **value-based, model-free** RL algorithm. It learns a Q-function, which estimates the expected future rewards for taking a specific action in a given state. The agent then selects actions that maximize this Q-value."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are 'Deep Q-Networks' (DQNs)?",

          },
          "correct_answer": "A",
          "explanation": "**Deep Q-Networks (DQNs)** extend Q-learning by using **deep neural networks** to approximate the Q-value function. This allows DQNs to handle complex, high-dimensional state spaces (like raw pixel data from video games) where traditional Q-tables are infeasible."
        },

          },
          "correct_answer": "A",
          "explanation": "**Policy gradient** methods directly learn a parameterized policy that maps states to actions. Instead of learning a value function and then deriving a policy, they directly optimize the policy by estimating the gradient of the expected cumulative reward with respect to the policy's parameters."
