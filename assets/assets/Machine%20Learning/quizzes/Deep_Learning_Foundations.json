          },
          "correct_answer": "A",
          "explanation": "An artificial neuron takes inputs, multiplies them by **weights**, sums these weighted inputs, adds a **bias** term, and then passes the result through an **activation function** to produce its output."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the role of weights in a neural network?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To determine the architecture of the network.",
            "B": "To control the learning rate of the network.",
            "C": "To represent the strength of the connection between neurons and are adjusted during training.",
            "D": "To introduce non-linearity into the network."

          "question": "What is the purpose of the bias term in a neuron?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To scale the input values.",

          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The **bias term** in a neuron provides an offset to the weighted sum of inputs before the activation function is applied. It allows the neuron to activate or fire even when all input values are zero, essentially shifting the activation function to the left or right, enabling the model to fit a wider range of data."

            "C": "A function that optimizes the weights of the network.",
            "D": "A function that preprocesses the input data."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "An **activation function** is applied to the output of each neuron. Its primary role is to introduce **non-linearity** into the network, enabling it to learn and model complex, non-linear relationships in the data that simple linear models cannot capture."

          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "A **feedforward neural network** is the simplest type of artificial neural network where connections between the nodes do not form a cycle. Information flows only in one direction, from the input layer, through any hidden layers, and then to the output layer."

          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "**Hidden layers** are the intermediate layers located between the input and output layers. In these layers, the network performs most of its computation, learning complex, hierarchical representations of the input data through multiple transformations."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the output layer in a neural network?",

          "explanation": "The **output layer** is the final layer of a neural network. It produces the network's prediction or decision. The number of neurons and the choice of activation function in this layer depend on the specific task (e.g., one neuron for binary classification, multiple for multi-class classification or regression)."

            "B": "Employing neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks) to learn hierarchical representations of data.",
            "C": "Applying traditional machine learning algorithms to large datasets.",

          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "**Backpropagation** is the core algorithm used to train neural networks. It works by calculating the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight in the network, then propagating this error gradient backward from the output layer to the input layer, allowing for efficient adjustment of weights."
        },

          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The **learning rate** is a hyperparameter that determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of the loss function. A small learning rate means slow convergence, while a large learning rate can lead to overshooting the minimum or divergence."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is gradient descent?",
          "options": {

          "explanation": "**Gradient descent** is a first-order iterative optimization algorithm for finding the local minimum of a function. In deep learning, it's used to minimize the loss function by iteratively moving in the direction opposite to the gradient (the steepest descent) of the function."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the purpose of a loss function in deep learning?",
          "options": {

          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "A **loss function** (or cost function) quantifies how well a neural network is performing during training. It measures the discrepancy between the network's predicted output and the true target values. The goal of training is to minimize this loss function."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the difference between batch gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and mini-batch gradient descent?",
          "options": {
            "A": "They are all the same optimization algorithm.",
            "B": "They differ in the amount of data used to calculate the gradient in each update step (entire dataset, single data point, or a small subset, respectively).",

          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "These are variations of gradient descent that differ in how much data they use for each parameter update. **Batch gradient descent** uses the entire training dataset. **Stochastic gradient descent (SGD)** uses only one training example. **Mini-batch gradient descent** (the most common in deep learning) uses a small, randomly selected subset (mini-batch) of the training data."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the vanishing gradient problem in deep neural networks?",

            "D": "A problem related to overfitting on the training data."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The **vanishing gradient problem** occurs in deep neural networks when the gradients (used for updating weights) become extremely small as they are propagated backward through many layers. This makes the updates to the weights in earlier layers tiny, effectively stopping them from learning, leading to poor performance."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which activation function is known to potentially contribute to the vanishing gradient problem?",

            "D": "Leaky ReLU"
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The **Sigmoid** activation function is notorious for contributing to the vanishing gradient problem. Its derivative is very small (between 0 and 0.25), and when multiplied across many layers during backpropagation, the gradients can quickly shrink to near zero."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are some techniques used to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem?",
          "options": {

          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Several techniques address vanishing gradients: using **ReLU** and its variants (which don't saturate for positive inputs), **Batch Normalization** (which normalizes activations, keeping them in a stable range), and careful **weight initialization** (like He or Xavier initialization) to ensure gradients are within a reasonable range at the start of training."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the exploding gradient problem in deep neural networks?",
          "options": {
            "A": "A problem where the learning rate becomes too small.",
            "B": "A problem where gradients become very large during backpropagation, leading to unstable training.",

          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The **exploding gradient problem** is the opposite of vanishing gradients, where the gradients accumulate to be extremely large during backpropagation. This causes very large weight updates, leading to unstable training, oscillations, and potentially divergence of the model."
