          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Bayesian methods provide a framework for statistical inference where probability is used to quantify uncertainty about unknown parameters. They leverage **Bayes' theorem** to update prior beliefs about a hypothesis or parameter in the light of new evidence (data), resulting in a posterior distribution."

          "question": "What is the key difference between Bayesian and frequentist approaches to statistics and machine learning?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Bayesian methods rely on data, while frequentist methods rely on prior knowledge.",
            "B": "Bayesian methods treat parameters as random variables with probability distributions, while frequentist methods treat them as fixed but unknown.",

          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The core distinction lies in their view of parameters. **Bayesian methods** treat unknown parameters as **random variables** and incorporate **prior knowledge** through probability distributions. In contrast, **frequentist methods** consider parameters as **fixed, but unknown, constants** and focus on the probability of observing data given those fixed parameters."

Instead of learning a single task, it learns how to adapt to new tasks quickly and efficiently, often by leveraging experience from previous learning experiences."
