          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "In machine learning, a **feature** is an attribute or characteristic of the data that the model uses to make predictions. For example, in predicting house prices, features could be 'number of bedrooms' or 'square footage'."

          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "**Overfitting** occurs when a model becomes too complex and learns the training data's noise and specific patterns rather than the underlying trends. This leads to excellent performance on the training data but poor performance on new, unseen data."

            "D": "When the learning rate is set too high."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "**Underfitting** happens when a model is too simple to capture the complexity of the data. It performs poorly on both the training data and new data because it hasn't learned the fundamental relationships."

          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "The **bias-variance tradeoff** is a central concept where reducing **bias** (the error from overly simplistic assumptions, leading to underfitting) often increases **variance** (the error from sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training data, leading to overfitting), and vice-versa. Finding the right balance is key to building good models."

          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "**Hyperparameters** are configurations set by the data scientist *before* training (e.g., learning rate, number of layers). **Parameters** are internal variables of the model that are *learned from the data* during the training process (e.g., weights and biases in a neural network)."

          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "**Feature scaling** (like normalization or standardization) transforms numerical features to a similar range. This is important for many machine learning algorithms (e.g., those using distance calculations or gradient descent) to prevent features with larger values from dominating the learning process."
        },
