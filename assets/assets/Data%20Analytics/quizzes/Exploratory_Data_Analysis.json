          "question": "What is the primary goal of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To build predictive models.",
            "B": "To confirm pre-existing hypotheses about the data.",
            "C": "To understand the data's main characteristics, discover patterns, and formulate hypotheses.",
            "D": "To clean and preprocess the data for modeling."
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "EDA is the initial, critical step in data analysis. Its primary goal is to gain deep insights into the dataset, often without pre-conceived notions, to uncover underlying structures, anomalies, patterns, and relationships. This understanding then guides further analysis, feature engineering, and model selection, rather than being the final step of model building or hypothesis confirmation."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which of the following is a common technique used in EDA for summarizing the central tendency of a dataset?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Scatter plot",
            "B": "Histogram",
            "C": "Mean, median, and mode",
            "D": "Box plot"
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "Mean, median, and mode are fundamental statistical measures used to describe the 'center' or typical value of a numerical dataset. The mean is the average, the median is the middle value, and the mode is the most frequent value, each providing different insights into central tendency."
        },
        {
          "question": "What does the standard deviation measure in EDA?",
          "options": {
            "A": "The central value of the data.",
            "B": "The shape of the data distribution.",
            "C": "The spread or dispersion of the data around the mean.",
            "D": "The most frequent value in the data."
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "Standard deviation quantifies the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of data values. A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be close to the mean, while a high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a wider range of values."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which visualization tool is useful for displaying the distribution of a single numerical variable and identifying potential outliers?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Scatter plot",
            "B": "Line chart",
            "C": "Box plot",
            "D": "Pie chart"
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "A box plot (or box-and-whisker plot) effectively displays the five-number summary of a set of data: minimum, first quartile (Q1), median (Q2), third quartile (Q3), and maximum. It is particularly good at showing the spread of the data and clearly highlighting potential outliers as individual points beyond the 'whiskers'."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is a histogram used for in EDA?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To show the relationship between two numerical variables.",
            "B": "To compare categorical data.",
            "C": "To visualize the frequency distribution of a numerical variable.",
            "D": "To display trends over time."
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of numerical data. It divides the data into 'bins' (intervals) and shows how many data points fall into each bin, providing a visual understanding of the data's shape, central tendency, and spread."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which visualization is appropriate for exploring the relationship between two numerical variables?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Bar chart",
            "B": "Pie chart",
            "C": "Scatter plot",
            "D": "Histogram"
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "A scatter plot is the go-to visualization for showing the relationship between two numerical variables. Each point on the plot represents an observation with its values for both variables, allowing for the visual identification of correlation, clusters, or patterns."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the purpose of creating cross-tabulations (contingency tables) in EDA?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To visualize the distribution of a single numerical variable.",
            "B": "To examine the relationship between two or more categorical variables.",
            "C": "To identify missing values in the dataset.",
            "D": "To calculate summary statistics for numerical variables."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Cross-tabulations are tables that summarize the relationship between two or more categorical variables by displaying the frequency distribution of their combinations. They are excellent for understanding how categories of one variable relate to categories of another."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are missing values, and why are they important to consider during EDA?",
          "options": {
            "A": "They are values that are unusually high or low and should be removed.",
            "B": "They indicate a lack of data for certain observations and can affect analysis and modeling.",
            "C": "They are always imputed with the mean of the column.",
            "D": "They are irrelevant to the exploratory process."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Missing values (e.g., blank cells, 'NA', 'NaN') represent data that was not recorded or is unavailable. During EDA, it's crucial to identify their presence, quantity, and patterns, as they can bias statistical results, lead to incorrect conclusions, and need careful handling (e.g., imputation or removal) before modeling."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are outliers, and why should they be investigated during EDA?",
          "options": {
            "A": "They are the most frequent values in the dataset and should be the focus of analysis.",
            "B": "They are data points that deviate significantly from the rest of the data and may indicate errors or interesting phenomena.",
            "C": "They should always be removed before any further analysis.",
            "D": "They have no impact on statistical measures."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Outliers are observations that lie an abnormal distance from other values in a random sample from a population. They are important to investigate because they could be data entry errors, measurement errors, or genuinely rare and significant events that warrant further attention and can heavily influence statistical models and visualizations."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which statistical measure is sensitive to outliers?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Median",
            "B": "Mode",
            "C": "Mean",
            "D": "Interquartile Range (IQR)"
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "The mean is highly sensitive to outliers because it takes into account the value of every data point. A single extremely high or low value can significantly pull the mean in its direction. In contrast, the median and mode are robust to outliers as they are based on position or frequency, respectively."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the Interquartile Range (IQR) used for in EDA?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To measure the central tendency of the data.",
            "B": "To determine the overall range of the data.",
            "C": "To measure the spread of the middle 50% of the data and identify potential outliers.",
            "D": "To visualize the frequency distribution of the data."
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "The IQR is a measure of statistical dispersion, equal to the difference between the 75th percentile (Q3) and the 25th percentile (Q1). It represents the spread of the central 50% of the data and is particularly useful for identifying outliers, as values falling significantly outside 1.5 times the IQR from Q1 or Q3 are often considered outliers."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the purpose of data visualization in EDA?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To create aesthetically pleasing reports.",
            "B": "To summarize the data in a few key numbers.",
            "C": "To gain visual insights into the data's distribution, relationships, and potential anomalies.",
            "D": "To prepare the data for machine learning algorithms."
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "Data visualization is a core component of EDA. It allows analysts to visually inspect the data, making it easier to spot patterns, correlations, clusters, outliers, and distribution shapes that might be difficult to discern from raw numbers or summary statistics alone. It helps in forming hypotheses and understanding data characteristics intuitively."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which of the following is a common step in the EDA process?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Building a complex predictive model.",
            "B": "Deploying the model into a production environment.",
            "C": "Calculating summary statistics and creating visualizations.",
            "D": "Collecting large amounts of new data."
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "Calculating summary statistics (like mean, median, standard deviation) provides a numerical overview, while creating various visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, box plots) offers graphical insights. These are fundamental and iterative steps in EDA to understand the data's characteristics."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the benefit of performing EDA before formal modeling?",
          "options": {
            "A": "It guarantees a perfect predictive model.",
            "B": "It helps in understanding the data structure, identifying potential issues, and informing feature engineering and model selection.",
            "C": "It eliminates the need for data cleaning.",
            "D": "It automatically selects the best machine learning algorithm."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "EDA is crucial for laying a solid foundation for modeling. It helps uncover data quality issues (missing values, outliers), understand variable relationships, identify patterns, and determine appropriate transformations or feature engineering strategies, all of which directly impact the choice and performance of a predictive model."
        },
        {
          "question": "What does it mean if a scatter plot shows a strong positive correlation between two variables?",
          "options": {
            "A": "As one variable increases, the other variable tends to decrease.",
            "B": "As one variable increases, the other variable tends to increase.",
            "C": "There is no linear relationship between the two variables.",
            "D": "One variable causes the other to increase."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "A strong positive correlation on a scatter plot indicates that as the values of one variable increase, the values of the other variable also tend to increase in a consistent, linear fashion. The points would generally cluster along an upward-sloping line. It's important to remember that correlation does not imply causation."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is a pair plot (scatter plot matrix) useful for in EDA?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Visualizing the distribution of a single variable.",
            "B": "Examining the pairwise relationships between multiple numerical variables.",
            "C": "Comparing categorical variables.",
            "D": "Displaying trends over time for multiple series."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "A pair plot, or scatter plot matrix, generates scatter plots for all possible pairs of numerical variables in a dataset. Along the diagonals, it often shows histograms or kernel density estimates for individual variables. This provides a quick overview of relationships and distributions across multiple variables simultaneously."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the role of domain knowledge in EDA?",
          "options": {
            "A": "It is irrelevant to the EDA process.",
            "B": "It can help in interpreting patterns, formulating relevant questions, and guiding the analysis.",
            "C": "It is only important for the modeling phase.",
            "D": "It dictates the specific statistical tests that should be used."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Domain knowledge (expertise in the subject matter of the data) is invaluable during EDA. It helps in understanding what the variables represent, why certain patterns might exist, whether observed outliers are errors or significant, and what questions are most relevant to ask of the data, guiding a more insightful analysis."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the difference between univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis in EDA?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Univariate analyzes relationships, bivariate analyzes distributions, and multivariate analyzes central tendencies.",
            "B": "Univariate involves one variable, bivariate involves two variables, and multivariate involves more than two variables.",
            "C": "Univariate uses visualizations, bivariate uses statistics, and multivariate uses modeling.",
            "D": "There is no difference; these terms are interchangeable."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "These terms refer to the number of variables being analyzed at once: univariate analysis focuses on a single variable (e.g., its distribution), bivariate analysis examines the relationship between two variables, and multivariate analysis explores relationships among three or more variables simultaneously."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why is it important to document the findings and insights from EDA?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To make the EDA process longer.",
            "B": "To ensure reproducibility, facilitate communication, and guide subsequent steps in the data analysis process.",
            "C": "To keep the findings secret from stakeholders.",
            "D": "It is not necessary to document EDA findings."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Documenting EDA findings creates a clear record of the data's characteristics, discovered issues, and initial insights. This documentation is crucial for reproducibility, allows for effective communication with team members and stakeholders, and provides a roadmap for data cleaning, feature engineering, and model development."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the relationship between EDA and hypothesis generation?",
          "options": {
            "A": "EDA is used to test pre-existing hypotheses.",
            "B": "EDA helps in understanding the data, which can lead to the formulation of new hypotheses to be tested later.",
            "C": "Hypothesis generation is done before EDA.",
            "D": "There is no direct relationship between them."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "While hypothesis *testing* typically comes after EDA, EDA itself is often a powerful tool for *generating* hypotheses. By exploring the data, spotting patterns, or identifying anomalies, analysts can formulate new questions or assumptions about the underlying phenomena, which can then be rigorously tested with formal statistical methods or modeling."
