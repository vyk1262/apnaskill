          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "The fundamental purpose of data visualization is to make complex data understandable and accessible. By presenting data graphically, it helps audiences quickly grasp trends, patterns, and outliers that might be hidden in raw numbers, thus facilitating clearer communication of insights."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which of the following is a common type of data visualization used to show the relationship between two quantitative variables?",

          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "A scatter plot displays individual data points on a two-dimensional graph, where each axis represents a quantitative variable. This arrangement makes it excellent for identifying correlations, clusters, and outliers between two variables."
        },
        {
          "question": "What type of chart is best suited for showing parts of a whole?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Line Chart",
            "B": "Bar Chart",

          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "A pie chart represents parts of a whole, where each slice of the pie corresponds to a category's proportion of the total. While commonly used, it's generally most effective for a small number of categories."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which visualization is effective for comparing categorical data?",
          "options": {
