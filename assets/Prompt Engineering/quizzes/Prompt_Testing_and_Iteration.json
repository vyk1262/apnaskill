          "question": "What is the primary goal of 'Prompt Testing'?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To make prompts as long as possible.",
            "B": "To evaluate the effectiveness, reliability, and consistency of a prompt in achieving desired AI outputs across various inputs and scenarios.",
            "C": "To train the AI model from scratch.",

          "explanation": "Prompt testing is essential for ensuring that the prompt consistently delivers the intended results, identifies potential issues, and optimizes performance."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why is 'Iteration' a crucial part of prompt engineering?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To ensure the first prompt is always perfect.",
            "B": "Because it's rare for a prompt to be perfect on the first attempt; continuous refinement based on testing and observation is necessary to achieve optimal results.",
            "C": "To make the AI model respond slower.",
            "D": "To increase the cost of AI usage."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Prompt engineering is an iterative process. You test a prompt, observe its output, identify shortcomings, modify the prompt, and test again until the desired performance is met."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is a 'test case' in prompt testing?",
          "options": {
            "A": "A random word to test the AI.",
            "B": "A specific input scenario or example used to evaluate how the AI responds to a particular prompt, often with an expected output.",
            "C": "A type of AI model.",
            "D": "A piece of software used for AI training."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Test cases are concrete examples that you feed to your prompt to see if the AI behaves as expected. They should cover typical, edge, and potentially problematic scenarios."
        },
        {
          "question": "When designing test cases, why is it important to include 'edge cases' and 'adversarial examples'?",
          "options": {
            "A": "They are irrelevant to testing.",
            "B": "To identify prompt vulnerabilities, unintended behaviors, or failure modes where the AI might misinterpret or generate undesirable content.",
            "C": "To make testing faster.",

          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Edge cases (unusual but valid inputs) and adversarial examples (inputs designed to trick the AI) are vital for stress-testing prompts and ensuring robustness and safety."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is a 'golden answer' or 'expected output' in prompt testing?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Any response from the AI.",
            "B": "The predefined, ideal, or correct response that a prompt should generate for a given test case, used as a benchmark for evaluation.",

          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Having a clear expected output for each test case allows for objective comparison and assessment of the AI's performance. Without it, evaluation is subjective."

          "question": "How do you evaluate the output of a prompt during testing?",
          "options": {
            "A": "By counting the number of words.",
            "B": "By comparing the AI's generated response against the 'golden answer' based on criteria like relevance, accuracy, completeness, format adherence, and tone.",
            "C": "By checking the AI's internal parameters.",
            "D": "By only looking at the first sentence."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Evaluation involves qualitative and often quantitative assessment. It's about determining if the AI's output meets all the requirements specified (or implied) in the prompt."

          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "A/B testing is a common experimental design where variations of a prompt are shown to different segments of inputs (or users) to determine which version is more effective."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why is 'version control' important for prompts during iteration?",
          "options": {
            "A": "It's not important for prompts.",

          "options": {
            "A": "Only changing a single word.",
            "B": "Adding/removing context, clarifying instructions, rephrasing, adjusting examples, adding constraints, changing persona, or employing different design patterns (e.g., CoT).",
            "C": "Changing the AI model itself.",
            "D": "Modifying the AI's training data."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",

          "question": "What is the purpose of 'human evaluation' in prompt testing?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To automate all testing.",
            "B": "To assess subjective qualities like tone, creativity, naturalness, and nuance that automated metrics often cannot capture, providing critical qualitative feedback.",
            "C": "To replace AI models.",
            "D": "To make the AI model faster."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Many aspects of AI output quality, especially in natural language generation, require human judgment. Human evaluators can detect subtle errors, awkward phrasing, or inappropriate tones."

          "question": "What is 'quantitative evaluation' in prompt testing?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Evaluating only creative aspects.",
            "B": "Measuring prompt performance using numerical metrics, such as accuracy rate, exact match score, ROUGE/BLEU scores (for summarization/translation), or adherence to formatting rules.",

            "C": "It makes the AI model forget data.",
            "D": "It slows down prompt creation."
          },
