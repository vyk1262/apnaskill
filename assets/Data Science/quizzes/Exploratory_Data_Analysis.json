        {
          "question": "What is the primary goal of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To build predictive models.",
            "B": "To clean and preprocess the data.",
            "C": "To understand the data's main characteristics, patterns, anomalies, and relationships.",
            "D": "To deploy machine learning models."
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "EDA is the initial, crucial step in any data analysis project. Its main purpose is to gain insights into the dataset, discover hidden patterns, identify anomalies (outliers), test assumptions, and understand the relationships between different variables, all before formal modeling begins."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which of the following is a common technique used in EDA for numerical data?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Bar charts",
            "B": "Histograms",
            "C": "Pie charts",
            "D": "Word clouds"
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Histograms are ideal for visualizing the distribution of a single numerical variable. They show the frequency of data points within specified bins, helping to understand the shape, spread, and central tendency of the data."
        },
        {
          "question": "What type of plot is useful for visualizing the distribution of a single numerical variable and identifying potential outliers?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Scatter plot",
            "B": "Line plot",
            "C": "Box plot",
            "D": "Heatmap"
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "A box plot (or box-and-whisker plot) provides a concise summary of a numerical distribution, showing the median, quartiles, and potential outliers as individual points beyond the 'whiskers'. This makes it excellent for quickly grasping spread and spotting unusual values."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which EDA technique helps in understanding the relationship between two numerical variables?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Histogram",
            "B": "Box plot",
            "C": "Scatter plot",
            "D": "Violin plot"
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "A scatter plot displays individual data points on a two-dimensional graph, where each axis represents one of the numerical variables. This visual representation allows you to observe patterns, clusters, and the direction and strength of a relationship (e.g., positive, negative, or no correlation) between the two variables."
        },
        {
          "question": "What type of chart is typically used to display the frequency or proportion of different categories in categorical data?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Scatter plot",
            "B": "Histogram",
            "C": "Bar chart",
            "D": "Line plot"
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "Bar charts are perfect for categorical data. Each bar represents a category, and its height or length corresponds to the frequency or proportion of observations within that category, making it easy to compare sizes across categories."
        },
        {
          "question": "What does a correlation matrix help to visualize?",
          "options": {
            "A": "The distribution of individual variables.",
            "B": "The relationships between multiple numerical variables.",
            "C": "The frequency of categorical variables.",
            "D": "The trend of a variable over time."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "A correlation matrix is a table that displays the correlation coefficients between many variables. It's often visualized as a heatmap, where color intensity indicates the strength and direction of the linear relationship between each pair of numerical variables."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which of the following is a summary statistic that describes the central tendency of a numerical dataset?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Range",
            "B": "Variance",
            "C": "Median",
            "D": "Standard deviation"
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "The median is a measure of central tendency that represents the middle value in a dataset when it's ordered from least to greatest. It's less affected by extreme outliers than the mean, making it a robust indicator of the 'typical' value."
        },
        {
          "question": "What does the standard deviation measure?",
          "options": {
            "A": "The central value of the data.",
            "B": "The spread or dispersion of the data around the mean.",
            "C": "The shape of the data distribution.",
            "D": "The correlation between variables."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Standard deviation quantifies the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of data values. A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be close to the mean, while a high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a wider range of values."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the interquartile range (IQR) used for in EDA?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To measure the central tendency of the data.",
            "B": "To measure the total spread of the data.",
            "C": "To measure the spread of the middle 50% of the data and identify potential outliers.",
            "D": "To determine the correlation between variables."
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "The IQR is the range between the first quartile (25th percentile) and the third quartile (75th percentile). It describes the spread of the central portion of the data, and it's particularly useful for identifying outliers, as values falling significantly outside 1.5 times the IQR are often considered outliers."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the purpose of identifying missing values during EDA?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To remove all rows with missing values.",
            "B": "To decide how to handle or impute missing data for further analysis.",
            "C": "To convert missing values into a specific numerical value.",
            "D": "Missing values do not affect data analysis."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Identifying missing values is crucial because they can introduce bias, reduce statistical power, and cause errors in models. During EDA, you assess the extent and pattern of missingness to decide on appropriate strategies, such as imputation (filling in missing values) or removal of rows/columns, to ensure data quality for subsequent steps."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are the benefits of using visualizations in EDA?",
          "options": {
            "A": "They always provide definitive answers.",
            "B": "They can reveal patterns, trends, and outliers that might not be apparent in summary statistics alone.",
            "C": "They are only useful for presenting the final results.",
            "D": "They eliminate the need for statistical analysis."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Visualizations are incredibly powerful in EDA because the human eye is adept at spotting visual patterns. Plots can quickly highlight distributions, relationships, anomalies, and trends that might be missed or are difficult to discern when simply looking at raw numbers or summary statistics."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is a heatmap commonly used for in EDA?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Visualizing the distribution of a single variable.",
            "B": "Displaying the correlation matrix between multiple numerical variables.",
            "C": "Showing the trend of a variable over time.",
            "D": "Representing categorical data frequencies."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Heatmaps are excellent for visualizing matrices, especially correlation matrices. They use a gradient of colors to represent the strength and direction of the relationships between pairs of variables, making it easy to quickly identify highly correlated or uncorrelated features."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the purpose of a pair plot (scatter plot matrix)?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To visualize the distribution of a single variable.",
            "B": "To visualize the pairwise relationships between multiple numerical variables.",
            "C": "To show the hierarchical clustering of data points.",
            "D": "To display geographical data."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "A pair plot, also known as a scatter plot matrix, is a grid of scatter plots where each plot shows the relationship between two different variables. The diagonal often shows histograms or kernel density estimates of each variable, providing a comprehensive overview of both individual distributions and pairwise relationships within a dataset."
        },
        {
          "question": "What insights can be gained from examining the distribution of a variable?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Only the mean and median.",
            "B": "The central tendency, spread, skewness, and presence of multiple modes.",
            "C": "The correlation with other variables.",
            "D": "The number of missing values."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Analyzing a variable's distribution (often with histograms or density plots) provides a rich understanding of its characteristics. You can see where most data points lie (central tendency), how spread out they are (spread), if the data is asymmetrical (skewness), and if there are distinct peaks indicating different subgroups (multiple modes)."
        },
        {
          "question": "What does a skewed distribution indicate?",
          "options": {
            "A": "The data is perfectly symmetrical.",
            "B": "The data has a long tail on one side of the distribution.",
            "C": "The data has a very narrow spread.",
            "D": "The data has no central tendency."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "A skewed distribution is asymmetrical, meaning that the data points are not evenly distributed around the mean. A 'long tail' on one side indicates that there are more extreme values extending in that direction (e.g., positive/right skew if the tail is to the right, negative/left skew if to the left)."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the role of domain knowledge in performing EDA?",
          "options": {
            "A": "It is not relevant to EDA.",
            "B": "It helps in formulating relevant questions, interpreting findings, and identifying potential anomalies.",
            "C": "It is only needed for the data collection phase.",
            "D": "It is primarily used for building machine learning models."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Domain knowledge is crucial for effective EDA. It allows you to ask meaningful questions about the data, understand the context of the variables, interpret unexpected patterns or outliers (e.g., is an outlier a data entry error or a significant event?), and validate whether the insights derived from EDA align with real-world understanding."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the difference between univariate, bivariate, and multivariate EDA?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Univariate deals with time series data, bivariate with spatial data, and multivariate with textual data.",
            "B": "Univariate explores one variable at a time, bivariate explores the relationship between two variables, and multivariate explores relationships among three or more variables.",
            "C": "Univariate uses tables, bivariate uses charts, and multivariate uses statistical models.",
            "D": "There is no significant difference between them."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "These terms refer to the number of variables being analyzed simultaneously. **Univariate EDA** focuses on individual variables (e.g., mean, median, histogram of 'age'). **Bivariate EDA** examines the relationship between two variables (e.g., scatter plot of 'age' vs. 'income'). **Multivariate EDA** investigates relationships among three or more variables (e.g., a pair plot or a 3D scatter plot)."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which of the following is a tool or library commonly used for EDA in Python?",
          "options": {
            "A": "TensorFlow",
            "B": "PyTorch",
            "C": "Pandas and Matplotlib/Seaborn",
            "D": "SQLAlchemy"
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "**Pandas** is fundamental for data manipulation and analysis in Python, providing data structures like DataFrames. **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** are powerful libraries for creating static, interactive, and aesthetically pleasing statistical visualizations, which are integral to EDA."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the importance of documenting the findings of an EDA process?",
          "options": {
            "A": "It is not necessary as EDA is just an initial step.",
            "B": "It helps in communicating insights, justifying subsequent steps in the data science pipeline, and ensuring reproducibility.",
            "C": "It is only useful for academic research.",
            "D": "It is primarily for data cleaning purposes."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Documenting EDA findings is critical for several reasons: it captures the understanding gained about the data, serves as a record of decisions made (e.g., regarding outlier handling or feature engineering), allows others to understand and reproduce your analysis, and provides a clear rationale for the subsequent steps taken in the data science project."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the relationship between EDA and hypothesis generation?",
          "options": {
            "A": "EDA is performed after hypothesis testing.",
            "B": "EDA can help in formulating initial hypotheses about the data that can be tested later.",
            "C": "Hypothesis generation is not related to EDA.",
            "D": "EDA is only used to confirm existing hypotheses."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "EDA is often an iterative process that can lead to the formation of new hypotheses. By exploring the data visually and statistically, data scientists can observe unexpected patterns, correlations, or anomalies that spark questions and lead to educated guesses (hypotheses) about the underlying phenomena, which can then be rigorously tested using formal statistical methods."
