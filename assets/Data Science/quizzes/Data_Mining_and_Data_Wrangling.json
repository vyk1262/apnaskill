            "C": "Data cleaning, data transformation, and data integration",
            "D": "Algorithm selection"
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "Data wrangling is an umbrella term that encompasses several critical steps to prepare data for analysis. These include data cleaning (handling missing values, outliers, inconsistencies), data transformation (changing data types, scaling, aggregation), and data integration (combining data from multiple sources). Model deployment, feature selection (often part of feature engineering, which overlaps but is distinct), and algorithm selection are typically part of the data mining or machine learning phase after wrangling."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the purpose of data cleaning?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To reduce the size of the dataset.",
            "B": "To improve the visual appeal of the data.",
            "C": "To handle missing values, identify and treat outliers, and correct inconsistencies in the data.",
            "D": "To combine data from multiple sources."
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "Data cleaning is the process of detecting and correcting (or removing) errors and inconsistencies in data to improve its quality. This includes dealing with missing values (e.g., imputation), identifying and addressing outliers, resolving data inconsistencies (e.g., different spellings of the same entity), and removing duplicates. Clean data is essential for accurate analysis."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which technique can be used to handle missing categorical data?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Imputation with the mean.",
            "B": "Deletion of rows with missing values.",
            "C": "Imputation with the mode or creating a new 'missing' category.",
            "D": "Linear interpolation."
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "For missing categorical data, common imputation strategies involve filling the missing values with the mode (the most frequent category) or creating a new specific category like 'Unknown' or 'Missing'. Imputation with the mean or linear interpolation are suitable for numerical data, while deleting rows can lead to data loss, especially if many rows have missing values."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is data transformation in the context of data wrangling?",
          "options": {
            "A": "The process of identifying patterns in data.",

          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Data transformation modifies the data to make it more suitable for analysis. This can include scaling numerical features (e.g., normalization or standardization), converting data types (e.g., string to numeric), encoding categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding), or aggregating data to a different granularity."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is data integration?",
          "options": {

            "C": "The process of transforming data into a specific format.",
            "D": "The process of visualizing relationships between variables."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Data integration is the process of bringing together data from disparate sources (e.g., different databases, files, APIs) and combining them into a single, cohesive, and consistent dataset. This unified view allows for a more comprehensive analysis that leverages information from all relevant sources."
        },
        {
          "question": "What challenges can arise during data integration?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Consistent data formats across all sources.",

          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Data integration is often complex due to several challenges. These include handling different data formats and schemas (how data is structured), resolving semantic heterogeneity (where the same term means different things or different terms mean the same thing), dealing with inconsistent naming conventions, and identifying and resolving duplicate records."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is feature selection in data mining?",
          "options": {
            "A": "The process of creating new features from existing ones.",
            "B": "The process of identifying and selecting the most relevant features for a data mining task.",

            "D": "The process of handling missing values in features."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Feature selection is a data preprocessing technique that aims to reduce the number of input variables to a model by eliminating irrelevant or redundant features. The goal is to improve model performance (accuracy), reduce training time, and enhance interpretability by focusing on the most informative features."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is association rule mining?",

          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "Association rule mining is an unsupervised data mining technique that discovers interesting relationships or 'association rules' among items in large datasets. A classic example is market basket analysis, which finds items frequently bought together (e.g., 'customers who buy bread also buy milk')."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are support and confidence in association rule mining?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Measures of the accuracy of a classification model.",
            "B": "Metrics used to evaluate the strength and reliability of association rules.",

          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Clustering is an unsupervised learning task in data mining where the goal is to group a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. Unlike classification, there are no predefined categories; the algorithm discovers the groupings inherently present in the data."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which of the following is a common clustering algorithm?",
          "options": {

          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "K-Means is one of the most popular and widely used clustering algorithms. It partitions data into 'k' number of clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (centroid). Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines are supervised learning algorithms (regression or classification)."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is classification in data mining?",
          "options": {
            "A": "The process of grouping similar data points.",

          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Classification is a supervised data mining technique where the goal is to build a model that can predict the category or class of a new, unseen data point based on learned patterns from labeled training data. The categories are predefined (e.g., spam/not spam, benign/malignant tumor)."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which of the following is a common classification algorithm?",
          "options": {

        },
        {
          "question": "What is data exploration and how does it relate to data mining and wrangling?",
          "options": {
            "A": "It is the final step of presenting findings; it comes after mining and wrangling.",
            "B": "It is the initial step of understanding the data, which helps guide the wrangling and mining processes.",
            "C": "It is a separate field that is not related to data mining or wrangling.",
            "D": "It primarily focuses on building predictive models."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Data exploration (often called Exploratory Data Analysis or EDA) is typically an initial and iterative step in the data science pipeline. It involves using visualizations and descriptive statistics to understand the data's characteristics, identify patterns, detect anomalies, and uncover relationships. The insights gained from EDA are crucial for guiding decisions in data wrangling (e.g., how to handle outliers) and selecting appropriate data mining techniques."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are some common tools or libraries used for data wrangling in Python?",

          "explanation": "Pandas is a cornerstone library in Python for data manipulation and analysis, offering powerful data structures like DataFrames that are ideal for cleaning, transforming, and reshaping tabular data. NumPy provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays, making it essential for numerical operations within data wrangling. TensorFlow and PyTorch are deep learning frameworks, Matplotlib/Seaborn are for visualization, and SQLAlchemy/psycopg2 are for database interaction."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why is domain knowledge important in data mining and data wrangling?",
          "options": {
            "A": "It is not necessary as the data speaks for itself.",
            "B": "It helps in understanding the context of the data, formulating meaningful questions, and interpreting the discovered patterns.",
            "C": "It is only required for presenting the final results.",
            "D": "It is primarily used for choosing the right algorithms."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Domain knowledge is crucial at every stage. In data wrangling, it helps in identifying relevant features, understanding why certain data points might be missing or inconsistent, and deciding on appropriate cleaning or transformation strategies. In data mining, it allows analysts to formulate meaningful hypotheses, interpret the patterns discovered by algorithms in a real-world context, and distinguish between statistically significant but practically irrelevant findings."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the potential impact of poorly performed data wrangling on data mining results?",

            "C": "It has no significant impact if the mining algorithms are robust.",
            "D": "It primarily affects the visualization of the results."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Poor data wrangling is often cited as the root cause of failures in data science projects. If the data is dirty, inconsistent, or improperly formatted, even the most sophisticated data mining algorithms will produce inaccurate, unreliable, or misleading results. This is famously summarized as 'garbage in, garbage out' (GIGO). The quality of the input data directly dictates the quality of the insights and models derived from it."
