            "A": "Time series data always has more features.",
            "B": "Time series data has a natural temporal ordering, where observations are dependent on previous observations.",

          "question": "Which of the following is a common component of a time series?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Feature Engineering",

          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Time series data can typically be decomposed into trend (long-term increase/decrease), seasonality (repeating patterns), and residual (random fluctuations)."
        },
        {
          "question": "What does 'stationarity' mean in the context of time series analysis?",
          "options": {
            "A": "The time series data is perfectly linear.",

          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Many traditional time series models (like ARIMA) assume stationarity. Non-stationary series often need to be transformed (e.g., differencing) to achieve stationarity."

          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Differencing involves calculating the difference between consecutive observations, which can stabilize the mean of a time series by removing changes in the level of a time series, and thus eliminating trend or seasonality."

          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Out-of-sample evaluation simulates how the model would perform in a real forecasting scenario, as it makes predictions on data it has not seen."

          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Observing that two series move together doesn't mean one causes the other; they might both be driven by an unobserved common cause. Establishing true causality requires careful study and domain knowledge."
