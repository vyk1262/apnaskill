            "D": "Summary tables created for high-level reporting."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Dimension tables in a star schema describe the 'who, what, where, when, why, and how' related to the facts. They contain descriptive attributes that allow users to slice, dice, and drill down into the factual data (e.g., Customer, Product, Time, Location)."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the difference between a star schema and a snowflake schema?",
          "options": {
            "A": "A star schema has more fact tables than a snowflake schema.",
            "B": "A snowflake schema normalizes dimension tables further, creating a more complex structure than a star schema.",
            "C": "A star schema is used for real-time data, while a snowflake schema is for historical data.",
            "D": "There is no structural difference between them; they are just different names for the same concept."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The key difference is that a snowflake schema normalizes its dimension tables. Instead of a single dimension table, it may have multiple normalized tables linked together, forming a snowflake-like structure, which can save space but increase query complexity compared to a star schema."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the purpose of data staging in the ETL process?",
