          "question": "What is the primary goal of data quality management?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To increase the volume of data collected.",
            "B": "To ensure data is fit for its intended uses.",
            "C": "To accelerate the speed of data processing.",
            "D": "To reduce the cost of data storage."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The core objective of data quality management is to ensure that data is accurate, complete, consistent, timely, and relevant, making it reliable and suitable for its specific business purposes, whether for operations or analytics."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which of the following is a key dimension of data quality?",
          "options": {

          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "Completeness is a vital data quality dimension, referring to the degree to which all necessary or expected data values are present and not missing. Volume, Velocity, and Variety are characteristics of Big Data, not direct dimensions of data quality itself."
        },
        {
          "question": "What does 'Accuracy' refer to as a dimension of data quality?",
          "options": {

          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "Timeliness indicates that the data is current enough to be useful for the specific context or decision. For example, stock prices need to be extremely timely, while quarterly sales figures have different timeliness requirements."
