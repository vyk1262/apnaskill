            "D": "Data Acquisition"
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "While dashboards can be part of monitoring in deployment, the primary phase for creating reports, dashboards, and other visual aids to convey findings to stakeholders is the 'Communication/Presentation' phase, which often follows or is integrated with 'Evaluation'."

          "options": {
            "A": "Real-time applications do not require a deployment phase.",
            "B": "Real-time deployment involves integrating the model into a continuous data stream, while batch deployment processes data at scheduled intervals.",
            "C": "Batch processing is always more complex to deploy.",
            "D": "The evaluation metrics are different for real-time systems."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "For real-time applications, deployment means integrating the model to process data as it arrives (e.g., scoring transactions instantly). For batch systems, deployment involves scheduling the model to run on data processed at regular, predefined intervals."

            "D": "Deployment"
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "While competitive analysis might inform the 'Business Understanding' phase, it is not a standalone core phase within the typical Data Analytics Lifecycle models (e.g., CRISP-DM, SEMMA). The core phases generally focus on the data and analytical process itself."
