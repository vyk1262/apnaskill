          "question": "What is the primary goal of predictive modeling?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To describe historical data.",
            "B": "To identify patterns in past data to forecast future outcomes.",
            "C": "To clean and preprocess data.",
            "D": "To visualize data insights."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Predictive modeling uses statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze historical and current data to identify patterns and relationships. The ultimate goal is to build a model that can make informed forecasts or predictions about future events or unknown outcomes, rather than just describing the past or cleaning data."

        {
          "question": "Which of the following is a supervised learning technique used for prediction?",
          "options": {
            "A": "K-Means Clustering",
            "B": "Principal Component Analysis (PCA)",

            "D": "Association Rule Mining"
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "Supervised learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset, meaning the input data has a corresponding output or 'target' variable. Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm that predicts a continuous target variable based on input features. K-Means, PCA, and Association Rule Mining are unsupervised learning techniques."
        },
        {
          "question": "What type of predictive modeling is used when the target variable is continuous?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Classification",
            "B": "Clustering",
            "C": "Regression",
            "D": "Association"
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "Regression is a type of predictive modeling used when the target variable is continuous, meaning it can take on any value within a range (e.g., house price, temperature, sales revenue). Classification is for categorical targets, while clustering and association are unsupervised tasks."

            "B": "Support Vector Machine (SVM)",
            "C": "Linear Regression",
            "D": "K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)"
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "Linear Regression is a fundamental statistical model that assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the continuous target variable. It models the relationship by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. Decision Trees, SVMs, and KNNs can also be used for regression, but Linear Regression is the classic linear model."

        {
          "question": "What is the purpose of splitting a dataset into training and testing sets in predictive modeling?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To increase the size of the dataset.",
            "B": "To evaluate the performance of the model on unseen data.",
            "C": "To make the model training faster.",

          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Splitting data into training and testing sets is crucial to assess a model's generalization ability. The model learns from the training data, and then its performance is evaluated on the unseen test data. This helps determine how well the model will perform on new, real-world data and avoids overfitting (where the model performs well on training data but poorly on new data)."

        {
          "question": "Which of the following is a common metric used to evaluate the performance of a regression model?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Accuracy",
            "B": "Precision",
            "C": "Mean Squared Error (MSE)",
            "D": "F1-Score"
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "Mean Squared Error (MSE) is a widely used metric for regression models. It calculates the average of the squared differences between the predicted values and the actual values. Lower MSE indicates a better fit of the model to the data. Accuracy, Precision, and F1-Score are metrics used for classification problems."

          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "Classification is the type of predictive modeling used when the target variable is categorical, meaning it falls into discrete categories or classes (e.g., spam/not spam, disease/no disease, customer churn/no churn). Regression is for continuous targets."

          "options": {
            "A": "To visualize the distribution of data points.",
            "B": "To evaluate the performance of a classification model by showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.",
            "C": "To identify the most important features in the data.",
            "D": "To reduce the dimensionality of the data."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model on a set of test data. It breaks down the predictions into four categories: True Positives (correctly predicted positive), True Negatives (correctly predicted negative), False Positives (incorrectly predicted positive), and False Negatives (incorrectly predicted negative). This detailed breakdown allows for the calculation of various classification metrics."

            "C": "To predict the probability of a binary outcome.",
            "D": "To reduce the number of features in the data."
          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "Despite 'Regression' in its name, Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm. Its goal is to model the probability of a binary outcome (e.g., 0 or 1, true or false) based on the input features by using a logistic (sigmoid) function to map the linear combination of inputs to a probability between 0 and 1."

          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "Random Forest is a prominent example of an ensemble method. It operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees during training and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees."

          "question": "What is the purpose of cross-validation in predictive modeling?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To increase the training data size.",
            "B": "To get a more robust estimate of the model's performance by training and evaluating it on multiple subsets of the data.",
            "C": "To simplify the model architecture.",
            "D": "To visualize the model's decision boundaries."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Cross-validation is a resampling procedure used to evaluate machine learning models on a limited data sample. It involves partitioning the data into multiple folds, training the model on some folds, and testing on others, then averaging the performance. This provides a more reliable estimate of model performance and helps detect overfitting compared to a single train-test split."

            "B": "A method to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the model's loss function.",
            "C": "A way to select the most important features.",
            "D": "A technique for scaling features."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Regularization is a technique used in linear models (like Linear and Logistic Regression) to prevent overfitting. It works by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages the model from assigning excessively large weights to features, thereby simplifying the model and making it more generalizable."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which of the following is a time series forecasting technique?",
          "options": {

          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "ARIMA is a class of models specifically designed for analyzing and forecasting time series data. It accounts for autocorrelation (AR), differencing to achieve stationarity (I), and moving average components (MA) to model the patterns in data collected over time. SVM, K-Means, and Naive Bayes are not inherently time series specific."

          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "The bias-variance tradeoff is a central concept in machine learning. High bias models are too simple and underfit the data (fail to capture true relationships), leading to high errors on both training and test sets. High variance models are too complex and overfit the training data (memorize noise), leading to low training error but high test error. The goal is to find a balance between bias and variance for optimal generalization."

          "question": "What is hyperparameter tuning in machine learning?",
          "options": {

          },
          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "Hyperparameters are external configuration properties of a machine learning algorithm whose values are set before the learning process begins (e.g., learning rate in neural networks, number of trees in a Random Forest, 'k' in K-Nearest Neighbors). Hyperparameter tuning is the process of finding the optimal combination of these values to achieve the best model performance, typically done through techniques like Grid Search or Random Search."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why is model interpretability important in some predictive modeling applications?",
          "options": {
            "A": "It always leads to better predictive accuracy.",
            "B": "It helps in understanding why a model makes certain predictions, which is crucial for trust, debugging, and regulatory compliance in some domains.",
            "C": "It makes the model training process faster.",
            "D": "It reduces the complexity of the model."
          },
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Model interpretability refers to the ability to understand *why* a model made a specific prediction. In critical applications like healthcare, finance (loan approvals), or legal decisions, knowing the rationale behind a prediction is vital for building trust, identifying potential biases, debugging errors, and meeting regulatory requirements, even if it sometimes comes at the cost of slight predictive accuracy compared to 'black-box' models."
